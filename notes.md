Git "Cheat Sheet"
===

Committing files
---

To automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, include -a; eg:

	git commit -a

Creating a new branch ("next-release")
---

You could use `git branch`, but if you've already modified some files that you now want to 
move to a new branch:

	git checkout -b next-release

Pushing a new branch ("next-release")
---

If `git push` reports:

	fatal: The current branch next-release has no upstream branch.
    To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

        git push --set-upstream origin next-release

do what it recommends (*-u* is shorthand for *--set-upstream*):

	git push -u origin next-release

Reverting (resetting) a single file [[link](http://www.norbauer.com/rails-consulting/notes/git-revert-reset-a-single-file.html)]
---

If you have an uncommitted change (it's only in your working copy) that you wish to revert (in SVN terms)
to the copy in your latest commit, do the following:

	git checkout filename

This will checkout the file from HEAD, overwriting your change. This command is also used to checkout branches,
and you could happen to have a file with the same name as a branch. All is not lost, you will simply need to type:

	git checkout -- filename

You can also do this with files from other branches, and such. `man git-checkout` has the details.

The rest of the Internet will tell you to use `git reset --hard`, but this resets all uncommitted changes youâ€™ve
made in your working copy. Type this with care.

Amending a commit
---

Sometimes I'm too quick with the "Commit and Push" button, and I've left a stale comment in the comment field.
To correct that:

	git commit --amend -m "New comment"

Unfortunately, updating the remote is not as simple as `git push`, which will complain:

	Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart.
	Integrate the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.

But in this case, there's nothing to pull, so force the push (this example assumes the current branch is *master*):

	git push -f origin master

Node "Cheat Sheet"
===

Installing Node (and NPM)
---

I downloaded and installed Node v0.11.11 [node-v0.11.11.pkg](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.11.11/node-v0.11.11.pkg),
which appears to be the newest version of Node that does *not* suffer from a [serious regression](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9310)
on OS X.  In newer versions of Node, the REPL blocks execution of the application until keys are typed.

That Node package came bundled with its own version of NPM as well: v1.3.25.

Markdown "Cheat Sheet"
===

To convert PCjs' special links, such as:

	![IBM PC XT w/CGA, 10Mb Hard Drive](/devices/pcx86/machine/5160/cga/256kb/demo/thumbnail.jpg "link:/devices/pcx86/machine/5160/cga/256kb/demo/:200:100")

to normal Markdown links, search using this regex:

	\!\[(.*?)\]\((.*?) \"link:(.*?):([0-9]*):([0-9]*)\"\)

and replace using this regex:

	[<img src="$2" width="$4" height="$5" alt="$1"/>]($3)

For magazines (eg, BYTE), change:

	\!\[(.*?)\]\(../archive/([^)]*) \"link:../archive/(.*?):([0-9]*):([0-9]*)\"\)

to:

	[<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/archive.pcjs.org/pubs/pc/magazines/BYTE/$2" width="$4" height="$5" alt= "$1"/>](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/archive.pcjs.org/pubs/pc/magazines/BYTE/$3)

Jekyll "Cheat Sheet"
===

The [README](README.md) still assumes that you'll use the Node web server with the PCjs project, and it explains how
to do that.

However, if you'd rather use Jekyll to locally serve PCjs web pages (since that www.pcjs.org does now, thanks to
to GitHub Pages), the basic steps are below.

NOTE: The Node web server *is* still supported.  In fact, I've put significant effort into updating the Node components
so that they recognize the Jekyll "Front Matter" that all pages now use to describe and load PCjs machines, allowing
me to continue debugging PCjs with WebStorm's built-in Node support.  But since I now run Jekyll's web server by
default (both locally and externally at www.pcjs.org), there will inevitably be some features that are "degraded" under
Node.  I don't have the time or bandwidth to keep every aspect of Node's server operation in perfect sync with Jekyll's.
The most obvious example of that are all the CSS style differences (colors, fonts, etc) between what Node and Jekyll
render; Node pages continue to display an older, darker color scheme, because the servers take completely different
approaches to templating.

Installing Jekyll
---

	sudo gem install bundler
	(create Gemfile:
		source 'https://rubygems.org'
		gem 'github-pages'
	)
	bundle install

Updating Jekyll
---

	bundle update

Running Jekyll
---

	bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --config _config.yml,_developer.yml

Once you see the following messages:

	...
	Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
	Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
	...

You should now be able to use [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to load PCjs web pages.

Note that **_developer.yml** is intended only for development purposes (it forces the use of uncompiled PCjs source
code, to make debugging easier, and enables certain developer-only portions of assorted pages); a production server
should not use that file.

Embedding Screenshots with Jekyll
---

I created screenshot.html in the **_includes** folder, so that I could do this:

	{% include screenshot.html src="/apps/pcx86/1981/donkey/thumbnail.jpg" width="200" height="100" link="/apps/pcx86/1981/donkey/" title="IBM PC running DONKEY.BAS" %}

instead of this:

	[<img src="/apps/pcx86/1981/donkey/thumbnail.jpg" width="200" height="100"/>](/apps/pcx86/1981/donkey/ "IBM PC running DONKEY.BAS")

The latter is better for pure Markdown environments, but the former enables Jekyll to properly style screenshots.


Miscellaneous Tips
===

Connecting to a VMware Fusion Serial Port
---

Step 1: Add a custom serial port to a VM, by appending the following lines to its *.vmx* file; eg:

	serial0.present = "TRUE"
    serial0.fileType = "pipe"
    serial0.yieldOnMsrRead = "TRUE"
    serial0.startConnected = "TRUE"
    serial0.fileName = "/tmp/serial0"

If this is the VM's first serial port, then it should appear as COM1.  If the VM is running Windows 95,
add the following to its *system.ini*:

	[386Enh]
    device=wdeb386.exe
    device=debugcmd.vxd
    LoadDebugOnlyObjs=Yes
    debugcmd=y /n
    debugcom=1
    debugbaud=9600
    debugsym=dos386.sym vmm.sym
    debugsym=krnl386.sym gdif.sym userf.sym kernel32.sym gdi32.sym user32.sym

Step 2: Run *netcat* (aka *nc* on OS X):

	stty raw && nc -U /tmp/serial0

Alternatively, you can run *socat* instead of *netcat*:

	socat -d -d UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/serial0 PTY

which will report:

	PTY is /dev/ttys002

indicating the name of serial device to connect to:

	screen /dev/ttys002

The advantage of using *nc* is that no "middle man" is required: your terminal window will be connected directly
to the virtual serial port.  And *nc* is included with OS X, whereas *socat* must installed separately (see
[http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/)).

TODO
===

- Since the "debugger" machine property is deprecated now, go ahead with removing it from all README machine configs
- Check PC Magazine Nov 29 1988, p. 402, for the CURSOR.PAS program, to test various cursor settings
