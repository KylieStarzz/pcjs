Personal Documents of Dubious Historical Interest
-------------------------------------------------

I'm kicking off this new section of the site with a couple of documents I created in 1984, detailing one of my early
adventures in PC debugging: decoding and removing [dBASE III Copy-Protection](#dbase-iii-copy-protection).

### dBASE III Copy-Protection

* [dBASE III Debugging Notes](/docs/personal/1984-09-16--DBASE_III_DEBUG.pdf)
* [dBASE III Patching Procedure](/docs/personal/1984-09-25--DBASE_III_PATCH.pdf)

NOTE: Copies of the [dBASE III](/disks/pcx86/apps/other/dbase3/) disks can be found in our [IBM PC Disk Library](/disks/pcx86/).
