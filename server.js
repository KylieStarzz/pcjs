/*
 * Usage:
 *
 *      node server.js [options]
 *
 * The options supported are basically just pass-through options for the HTMLOut module;
 * (eg, --cache, --console, --debug, --rebuild, and --sockets).  See HTMLOut for details.
 *
 * Options specific to this module include --logging, which turns on our own private logging
 * (redundant when running on a service like Azure), and --sockets (which we also pass on to
 * HTMLOut so that it can enable/disable client-side socket support).
