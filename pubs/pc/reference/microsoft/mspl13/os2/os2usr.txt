 textured bars in the left margin point out instructions for performing
 tasks.

 If separate sets of instructions are provided for the mouse and the
 keyboard, the mouse procedure is described first. If mouse and keyboard
 instructions appear in a two-column list, the mouse procedure is on the
 left, the keyboard procedure is on the right.

 The following list describes mouse actions used in this guide:

 Introduction

 Presentation Manager is a graphical environment in Microsoft Operating
 System/2 (MS OS/2) that presents applications in windows and is designed to
 provide an easy-to-use, standard interface for applications. You can quickly
 switch from one application to another by using a mouse or the keyboard. If
 you have not worked with a graphical interface before, there are a few
 skills and terms you need to learn. Once you master these skills, you can
 use them with any Presentation Manager application. This chapter provides
 information on the following Presentation Manager skills:

   ş   Selecting menus

   ş   Choosing commands

   ş   Using dialog boxes

   ş   Sizing, moving, and arranging windows

   ş   Using icons

   ş   Using Help




 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 All examples of filenames and directory names in this chapter use the file
 allocation table (FAT) file system, which is the file system used by DOS and
 MS OS/2 versions 1.1 and earlier. For information on using high-performance
 file system (HPFS) filenames and directory names, see Chapter 16, "Using the
 High-Performance File System."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Presentation Manager Basics

 In Presentation Manager, applications run in windows. These windows divide
 your screen so that you can see several different applications at one time.
 With Presentation Manager, there are several ways in which you can arrange
 windows and control applications. The following is a typical Presentation
 Manager window.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 The Presentation Manager Window


 Here are some terms that
 ill help you learn about and use Presentation Manager windows:
   ş   The selection cursor shows where you are in a window or in a dialog
       box. If you have a mouse installed, you will also see a mouse pointer
       shaped like an arrow.

   ş   The work area is where you do most of your work with an application.
       For example, if you start a text-editing application, the contents of
       a document file appear in the work area. In Desktop ManagerÄthe first
       application you see when you start Presentation ManagerÄthe work area
       contains a list of the program groups you can open. The work area of
       the Main-group window, which opens automatically when you start
       Presentation Manager, contains a list of applications you can start.

   ş   The title bar, located at the top of each window, displays the name of
       the application or group.

   ş   The menu bar contains the names of the command menus in an
       application.

   ş   The System-menu box represents the System menu. This menu is common to
       all Presentation Manager windows. You use its commands to size, move,
       and close windows, and to switch to other applications and groups.

   ş   The Maximize box enlarges your window. If you don't have a mouse, you
       can use the Maximize command from the System menu.

   ş   The Minimize box reduces your window to an icon. If you don't have a
       mouse, you can use the Minimize command from the System menu.

   ş   The icon area is the area along the bottom of your screen. When you
       reduce applications or groups to icons, the icons appear along the
       bottom of your screen. When you first start Presentation Manager, the
       icons for the DOS session and Print Manager appear at the bottom of
       your screen.





 Working in a Window

 In Presentation Manager, you must select the area or object your next action
 is going to affect. You select a window and then work in it, you select a
 menu and then choose a command, you select an area within a file and then do
 something to it. The way you select varies, depending on the task.
 Selections are displayed in a variety of ways. Remember this basic concept:
 First select, then carry out the action.

 Presentation Manager always shows you where you are in a window and what
 you've selected. The selection cursor identifies your place in a window or
 dialog box. You move the selection cursor by using either a mouse or the
 keyboard. The selection cursor changes shape, depending on the kind of
 application you're working with and the kind of task you're trying to
 accomplish. For example, in dialog boxes, the selection cursor is a dotted
 box that shows you which dialog-box option is selected.


 Selecting an Item in a Window

 In the work area of many windows, you can select only one item at a timeÄfor
 example, a disk-drive icon or an application.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 To select an item, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the item.                   Press the DIRECTION keys to move the
                                   selection cursor to the item.

 In some windows, you can select several objects at once. This action is
 called extending a selection. For more information, see the following
 section, "Extending a Selection in a Window."


 Extending a Selection in a Window

 In some windows, you can extend a selection to include more than one
 itemÄfor example, a block of files that are next to each other or files
 scattered throughout a window.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 The information in the following section on extending a selection does not
 apply to selecting in a list box. For more information on selecting in a
 list box, see "Working with a List Box," later in this chapter.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Dragging Icons

 If you are using a mouse, you can quickly perform specific tasks like
 starting an application, printing a file, or copying a file by dragging the
 appropriate icon. For example, if you want to print a file, you can drag the
 file icon onto the Print Manager icon or into the Print Manager window. Or
 you can start an application by dragging a data-file icon from File Manager
 onto a program icon or title in a group window. .RT

 Remember to use the right mouse button instead of the left mouse button when
 you drag icons. The left mouse button is used for selecting, and the right
 mouse button is used for dragging. To drag an icon, follow these steps:

   1.  Using the left mouse button, click the item (file or application) you
       want to select.

   2.  Hold down the right mouse button and move the mouse pointer.

       As soon as you start moving the mouse, the pointer becomes the icon
       for the selected item.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.  Continue moving the mouse until the icon is in the location you want
       (in a window or over another icon).

   4.  Release the mouse button.




 Switching Between Windows

 In Presentation Manager, the window you are
 currently working in is called the active window. The active-window title
 bar is a different color to distinguish the active window from other
 windows. Each time you start Presentation Manager, two Presentation Manager
 applications start automatically: Desktop Manager and Print Manager. The
 Main-group window opens automatically, and the DOS sessionÄa special
 environment for running DOS programsÄstarts as well. When you are running
 more than one application or have more than one group open, you must select
 the application or group you want to work in.

 There are several ways to switch between applications and groups. In this
 section, some of the methods for moving between applications are summarized.
 For more information on running applications and opening groups, see Chapter
 2, "Running Applications with MS OS/2."

 You can use the Task List to switch between applications. The Task List
 contains the names of all the applications you are running and of all the
 groups you have open.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 To display the Task List, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the right mouse button      Press CTRL+ESC.
 anywhere on the Presentation
 Manager background (outside of a
 window).

 Once the Task List is displayed, you can use it to switch to another
 application or group. To switch to another application or group, do the
 following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Double-click the application or   1  Press the UP or DOWN key to select
 group title.                      the application or group title you want.

                                   2  Press ENTER.

 You can also switch directly to an application or group without using the
 Task List. There are several techniques you can use depending on whether the
 application or group is running in a window or as an icon, and whether or
 not you have a mouse. If an application or group window is visible in the
 Presentation Manager screen, you can switch to it by using a mouse:

       Mouse 

   ş   To switch to an application or group window, click the window.


 Or

   ş   To switch to an application or group running as an icon, double-click
       the icon.


 To switch between applications (including full-screen applications) and
 groups by using the keyboard, do the following:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Press ALT+ESC.

   2.  Continue pressing ALT+ESC until the application or group you want
       appears.


 For more information on running applications and using the Task List, see
 Chapter 2, "Running Applications with MS OS/2."


 Commands and Menus

 Presentation Manager commands are organized in menus. Each application
 or group window has its own menus, with a System menu common to all windows.
 The System menu is represented by a box in the upper-left corner of each
 window; all other menus are repre- sented by names in the menu bar below the
 title bar at the top of each window, as shown in the following example.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 In Presentation Manager, you select a menu, then choose a command from that
 menu. Choosing a command carries out an action.


 Choosing a Command


 You can choose a command by using either a mouse or the keyboard. To choose a
 command by using a mouse, do the following:
       Mouse 

   1.  Click the menu name on the menu bar.

   2.  Click the command name.


 If you're using the keyboard, you have two ways to choose commands from
 menus: a basic method and a direct-access method. To choose a command by
 using the basic method, do the following:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Press ALT or F10 to select the menu bar.

   2.  Press the LEFT or RIGHT key to move to and select the menu you want.

   3.  Press ENTER to display the menu.

   4.  Press the UP or DOWN key to move to and select the command you want.

   5.  Press ENTER to choose the command.


 If an underlined letter appears in a command name or menu name, you can use
 the direct-access method. To choose a command by using the direct-access
 method, do the following:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Press ALT or F10.

   2.  Press the underlined letter in the menu name you want.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.  Press the underlined letter in the command name you want.



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If more than one menu or command name shares the same underlined letter,
 Presentation Manager selects the first menu or command listed. Press the
 underlined letter again to select the next menu or command. To see the menu
 or choose the command, press ENTER.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 If you decide you do not want to choose a command, you can cancel the menu.
 You can cancel a menu without making another selection by doing the
 following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click in a blank area outside of  Press ALT or F10.
 the menu.

 Pressing ESC also cancels the menu; however, the selection cursor remains on
 the menu bar so that you can select another menu. To move back to the
 application work area, press ESC again.

 A check mark next to a command name on a menu indicates the command has been
 chosen and is active.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 An ellipsis (...) next to a command name on a menu indicates that a dialog
 box will appear when the command is chosen. For more information, see "Using
 a Dialog Box," later in this chapter.


 The System Menu

 In addition to application menus, a System menu appears in the upper-left
 corner of each window; it is represented by the System-menu box.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 Although you choose commands from the System menu as you would from any
 other menu, you select the System menu in a different way. To select the
 System menu, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 In the upper-left corner of a     Press ALT+SPACEBAR or SHIFT+ESC.
 window, click the System-menu
 box; from an icon, click the
 icon.

 You use System-menu commands to manipulate windowsÄfor example, to change
 their size or move them on your screen, and to switch between applications
 and groups. Some dialog boxes also have System menus. The following list
 describes the System-menu commands:



 Command                           Action
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Restore                           Restores a window to its former size
                                   after it has been enlarged (by using the
                                   Maximize command) or reduced to an icon
                                   (by using the Minimize command).

 Move                              Moves a window to another location on
                                   your screen.

 Size                              Changes the size of a window.

 Minimize                          Reduces a window to an icon.

 Maximize                          Enlarges a window to its maximum size.

 Close                             Closes a window.

 Switch To                         Displays the Task List (a list of the
                                   applications you have running and the
                                   groups you have open).

 Some applications do not have all of these commands listed on their System
 menus. For example, the Close command is not on the System menu in Desktop
 Manager because you cannot close the Desktop Manager window.


 Commands in a Work-Area Window

 In some applications, such as File Manager, you can open windows in the
 application work area. These windows also have System menus, but you select
 them a little differently.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 To select the System menu from a window in an application, do the following:


 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the System-menu box in the  1  Press SHIFT+ESC to select the System
 window.                           menu in the main application window.

                                   2  Press the RIGHT key.

 The following is a keyboard shortcut for selecting the System menu from a
 window in an application:

       Keyboard 

   ş   Press CTRL - (hyphen key).

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).


 The commands on the System menu of a work-area window vary depending on the
 application; for example, in some Presentation Manager applications you
 cannot close work-area windows by using the Close command. For more
 information, see the manual for your application.


 Inactive Commands

 When you see a grayed command on a menu, it means the command is inactive
 and cannot be used.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 You may have to make a selection before you can use the command, or it may
 be that the command cannot be used with the current selection or active
 application. For example, you cannot use either the Minimize or the Size
 command when an application is reduced to an icon.

 Shortcut Keys

 Some menus have shortcut keys, usually listed to the right of the command
 name. Often these keys are a combination of a function key and the ALT,
 SHIFT, or CTRL key. You can use these keys to choose commands without first
 selecting the menu where each command is located. The following list shows
 the System-menu shortcut keys:

 Command                           Press
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Restore                           ALT+F5

 Move                              ALT+F7

 Size                              ALT+F8

 Minimize                          ALT+F9

 Maximize                          ALT+F10

 Close                             ALT+F4

 Switch To                         CTRL+ESC

 For example, to enlarge a window by using the Maximize command and its
 shortcut keys, you select the window and press ALT+F10.


 Using a Dialog Box

 Presentation Manager displays a dialog box when additional information is
 needed to carry out a command. Each dialog box contains areas where you
 provide information; there are different kinds of areas, depending on the
 kind of information needed. The following is a typical dialog box.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 The following are a few terms that will help you learn about and use dialog
 boxes:

   ş   The text box is where you type information. The text you type appears
       to the left of the insertion point, a flashing vertical line.

   ş   A list box contains the names of available choices. For example, in
       the illustration above, the names of directories appear in a list box.

   ş   A command button carries out a command when it is chosen. These
       buttons have labels that indicate what they doÄfor example, Rename,
       Cancel, or Help. Choosing a command button may cause another dialog
       box to be displayed. For example, choosing the Help button causes a
       Help dialog box to appear. A command button that displays other dialog
       boxes has an ellipsis (...) following its name.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   ş   A round option button is used to select an option for a particular
       command. In a group of option buttons, only one option at a time can
       be selected.

   ş   A square check box is also used to select an option for a particular
       command. In a group of check boxes, several or all options can be
       selected at one time.

   ş   A grayed command or grayed option is inactive, which means that it
       cannot currently be used.



 Dialog boxes usually display information that reflects what you have
 selected on your screenÄfor example, a filename in File Manager. They also
 display previously selected options or default settings of Presentation
 Manager options.

 Moving in a Dialog Box

 You can move around in a dialog box to make several selections from each
 group of options. The area you are working in is usually marked by a
 selection cursor or a flashing insertion point. Often, moving to an area
 selects the area as well.

 In some
 cases, you must move in an area to select one option from a group of
 optionsÄfor example, a filename in a list box or one option button in a
 group of option buttons. You can move to and select any item or area in a
 dialog box by doing the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the item or area.           Press TAB.

 To move in the opposite direction through a dialog box by using the
 keyboard, do the following:

       Keyboard 

   ş   Press SHIFT+TAB.


 Often, you can select an area by moving to it. However, sometimes you must
 also make a selection in the areaÄfor example, when you move to a check box.
 To select the option by using the keyboard, do the following:

       Keyboard 

   ş   Press the SPACEBAR.


 Pressing the SPACEBAR again cancels the selection.


 Selecting in a Dialog-Box Area

 Sometimes you must move and select inside a dialog-box areaÄfor example,
 when you want to select text in a text box. The mouse and keyboard
 techniques for selecting inside a dialog box are different from those you
 use for moving between areas or for selecting areas. Selection techniques
 may vary depending on the kind of area you are working in. The following
 sections explain how to move and select in each dialog-box area: text boxes,
 list boxes, option-button groups, check boxes, and command buttons.

 Working with a Text Box

 Often a text box, as shown in the following example, contains text that
 reflects a selection from your application window, such as a filename, or
 information about a particular file, such as an attribute.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 You can easily select and edit text in text boxes. To move to another
 location in a text box by using the mouse, do the following:

       Mouse 

   ş   Click the text you want to move to.


 To move to another location in a text box by using the keyboard, use the
 following keys:

 To the end of the text box        CTRL+END

 To insert new text, do the following:

   ş   Move to the location where you want the text to appear and begin
       typing.




 If you want to replace or edit text, you must first select the text you want
 to change. You can select text by using either a mouse or the keyboard. To
 select text in a text box, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard

 Working with MS OS/2 Messages

 When MS OS/2 encounters problems that require immediate action, it sends
 messages to your screen. There are several types of messages, depending on
 the type of problem encountered. When you are working in Presentation
 Manager, most messages appear in dialog boxes. A Presentation Manager
 message tells you what caused the problemÄfor example, if the application
 you are using cannot find a particular file. These dialog boxes also contain
 Cancel and Help buttons that you can use to cancel the message or to get
 further information.

 Other problems, especially those caused by your computer system, cause
 messages to appear in a full screen. For example, if you forget to close a
 disk-drive door when you attempt to format a floppy disk, a message may
 appear.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 The
 problem, identified by a message number, is shown along with the available
 options for correcting the problem. To choose an option, do the following:

 Introduction

 Presenta

   ş   Desktop Manager, a Presentation Manager application, is used to open
       program groups that run in separate windows. Each window can contain
       an application written for the graphical environment of Presentation
       Manager, as well as a DOS or a full-screen OS/2 application. A DOS
       application is an application that runs under the Microsoft disk
       operating system (MS-DOS) or a computer manufacturer's version of DOS.
       A full-screen OS/2 application is an application that runs in its own
       screen rather than as part of a Presentation Manager window. Some
       full-screen OS/2 applications are not designed to run in the graphical
       environment of Presentation Manager. Other full-screen OS/2
       applications can run in windows in Presentation Manager. Once you open
       a program group, you can start any application displayed in the work
       area of the program-group window.

   ş   The Task List is used for switching between applications and groups.
       You can use the Task List to switch to group windows, Presentation
       Manager applications, full-screen OS/2 applications, or one DOS
       application. All of your applications continue to run. You can switch
       between them without quitting or closing files. When you switch back
       to an application or group, you can con- tinue your work where you
       left off.


 .ET This chapter explains how to perform the following tasks:

   ş   Opening program groups by using Desktop Manager

   ş   Starting applications

   ş   Switching between applications by using a mouse, the keyboard, and the
       Task List

   ş   Creating, renaming, and deleting program groups from Desktop Manager

   ş   Adding applications to and deleting applications from program groups

   ş   Changing application information

   ş   Copying applications from one group to another

   ş   Running full-screen OS/2 applications in Presentation Manager windows

   ş   Quitting applications and closing windows


 .RT


 About Sessions

 In MS OS/2, there are three types of applications you can use: Presentation
 Manager applications, OS/2 full-screen applications, and DOS applications.
 Each type of application runs in a separate environment called a session.

 The Presentation Manager session is where you run Presentation Manager
 applicationsÄapplications written for the graphical environment of
 Presentation Manager. Desktop Manager is an example of a Presentation
 Manager application. It runs in a window, and you work with it by choosing
 commands and completing dialog boxes.

 Full-screen OS/2 applications run in a full-screen session. These are
 applications that are not designed for the Presentation Manager graphical
 environment. You can start up to 12 separate full-screen sessions, running
 one application in each session. In a full-screen session, you cannot see
 the Presentation Manager session. .ET

 You can return to the Presentation Manager session from a full-screen
 session at any time by using the Task List. When you switch back to the
 Presentation Manager session, you see each full-screen OS/2 session
 represented by an icon. Each session is also listed by name in the Task
 List.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 .RT
 Although full-screen OS/2 applications are not Presentation Manager
 applications, some can run in windows and share the screen with Presentation
 Manager applications. For example, the MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd, can
 run in a window. When a full-screen OS/2 application is running in a window,
 it is running in the Presentation Manager session. Many of the advantages of
 a Presentation Manager application are available through the System-menu
 commands. When you are working with a full-screen OS/2 application in a
 window, however, the commands, mouse, and keyboard work exactly as they do
 in a full screen.
 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 The DOS session is where you run applications designed to run with DOS. This
 session is like having a separate 640-kilobyte computer running DOS. You can
 run only one DOS application at a time, but Presentation Manager lets you
 switch to the DOS session any time you like by using the Task List. The DOS
 session starts when you start Presentation Manager and is represented on the
 Presentation Manager screen by the DOS icon. The DOS session is listed in
 the Task List as DOS.


 HPFS Filename Considerations

 The high-performance file system (HPFS) is an optional installable file
 system that greatly increases the speed of reading from and writing to your
 hard disk. When you use HPFS, you have greater flexibility in naming your
 files and directories than when you use the file allocation table (FAT) file
 system. For example, you can use longer names for HPFS files and you can
 include additional characters not allowed in FAT filenames.

 Because both DOS and some earlier versions of MS OS/2 use the FAT file
 system exclusively, applications written for these operating systems
 generally encounter problems when attempting to access files and directories
 named using the new HPFS naming rules. DOS and earlier MS OS/2 applications
 do not recognize these new filenames and therefore cannot access the files.

 All examples of filenames and directory names in this chapter use the FAT
 file system. For more information on HPFS filenames and directory names and
 how they are processed by DOS and earlier MS OS/2 applications, see Chapter
 16, "Using the High-Performance File System."


 Starting an Application with Desktop Manager

 With Desktop Manager, you can open program groups that contain your
 applications. Desktop Manager starts automatically and opens the Main group
 when you turn on your computer.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 Applications in the Main group are represented by icons, followed by their
 titles, in the work area of the Main-group window. Other program groups that
 contain applications appear in the work area of the Desktop Manager window.
 To start an application from a group window, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Double-click the application      1  Press the UP or DOWN key to move to
 name or icon.                     and select the application you want to
                                   start.

                                   2  Press ENTER.

 You can also use the Open command on the Program menu to start an
 application by doing the following:

   1.  Select the application in the group window.

   2.  Select the Program menu and choose the Open command.



 After you start an application from a group window, the window remains open.
 You can use the Minimize On Use command on the Program menu to automatically
 reduce the group window to an icon each time you start an application. To
 use the Minimize On Use command, do the following:
   ş   Select the Program menu and choose the Minimize On Use command.


 The appearance of your screen will depend on the kind of application you
 start. If you start a Presentation Manager application, like File Manager or
 Control Panel, the application runs in a window in front of other
 application or group windows.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 As shown in the following example, if you start a DOS application, such as
 Microsoft Works, the Presentation Manager screen disappears and the DOS
 application takes its place.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 If you start a full-screen OS/2 applicationÄfor example, OS/2 Full
 ScreenÄthe Presentation Manager screen disappears and the application screen
 takes its place.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 If the application is a full-screen OS/2 application that runs in a window,
 the application runs in a window in front of other Presentation Manager
 application windows.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 This window, however, is somewhat different from other Presentation Manager
 application windows. It has a System menu and a title bar, but no menu bar.
 For more detailed information on working with full-screen OS/2 applications
 running in windows, see "Working with a Full-Screen OS/2 Application in a
 Window," later in this chapter.


 Opening a Program Group

 Applications in Desktop Manager are divided into program groups and are
 represented as icons in the Desktop Manager window. When you start
 Presentation Manager, applications in the Main group automatically appear in
 a separate window.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 The following list describes the programs in the Main group:
   ş   File Manager is a Presentation Manager application that is used to
       view and organize files and directories. You can also use File Manager
       to start applications. You will find more details on using File
       Manager in Chapter 3, "Using File Manager."

   ş   OS/2 Window is the MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd, that runs in a
       window in Presentation Manager. Running cmd this way allows you to
       view your other applications. You can also reduce the cmd window to an
       icon.

   ş   OS/2 Full Screen is the MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd, that runs as
       a full-screen application. When you start this application, the
       Presentation Manager screen disappears and you see the MS OS/2 command
       prompt.

   ş   Print Manager is a Presentation Manager application that is used to
       manage and control printing jobs that have been sent to your printer.
       When you start MS OS/2, Print Manager starts automatically and runs as
       an icon in the icon area at the bottom of your screen.

   ş   OS/2 System Editor is a Presentation Manager text-processing
       application that is used to create and edit text files.

   ş   OS/2 Command Reference is a Presentation Manager application that is
       used to view the contents of the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command
       Reference. This reference contains general information as well as
       information on particular MS OS/2 commands.


 In addition to the Main group, Desktop Manager contains a Utilities group.
 The Utilities group contains the following utilities and applications:

   ş   Control Panel is a Presentation Manager application that is used to
       install printer drivers, to change country information and screen
       colors, and to set the date and time.

   ş   Copy Diskette is an MS OS/2 utility program that is used to duplicate
       a floppy disk.

   ş   Compare Diskettes is an MS OS/2 utility program that is used to
       compare the contents and the tracks of two floppy disks.

   ş   Label Diskettes is an MS OS/2 utility program that is used to assign a
       new volume label to a floppy disk.

   ş   Format Diskette is an MS OS/2 utility program that is used to format
       floppy disks in drive A.

   ş   Disk InformationÄCHKDSK is an MS OS/2 utility program that is used to
       check for errors and available storage space on your disks.

   ş   Fixed Disk Utility is a Presentation Manager utility program that is
       used to set up partitions on your hard disk and to assign drive
       letters to partitions.

   ş   Print Picture is a Presentation Manager application that is used for
       printing graphic document files that have a picture-interchange format
       or metafile format.

   ş   Display Picture is a Presentation Manager application that is used for
       displaying graphic document files on your screen.

   ş   Convert Picture is a Presentation Manager application that is used for
       converting files from picture-interchange format to metafile format
       (the format used in Presentation Manager).


 To open a program group by using a mouse, do the following:

       Mouse 

   1.  Switch to Desktop Manager.

   2.  Double-click the group name or icon.


 Do the following to open a group by using the keyboard:

   1.  Switch to Desktop Manager.

   2.  Press the DIRECTION keys to select the program group you want to open,
       as shown in the following example.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.  Press ENTER.


 You can also use the Open command on the Desktop Manager Group menu to open
 a program group. Do the following to use the Open command:

   1.  Switch to Desktop Manager.

   2.  Select the program group you want to open.

   3.  Select the Group menu and choose the Open command.




 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If a group is already open, using the Open command or double-clicking the
 group name in Desktop Manager makes the group window the active window.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 You can add new program groups to Desktop Manager by using the commands on
 the Group menu. Once you open a program group, you can change the
 applications in it by using the commands on the Program menu. For
 information on adding new groups, see "Creating a Program Group in Desktop
 Manager," later in this chapter. For information on changing applications in
 program groups, see "Adding an Application to a Program Group," "Changing
 Application Information," "Copying an Application to Another Group," and
 "Deleting an Application from a Program Group," later in this chapter.


 Starting an Application from File Manager

 In Presentation Manager, there are several ways you can start your
 applications. In addition to starting an application from a group window,
 you can also start an application by opening a program file in File Manager.
 Program files, as shown in the following example, usually have the filename
 extension .BAT, .EXE,

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 The information in this section is intended to be an introduction to File
 Manager. For more complete information on starting applications from File
 Manager, see Chapter 3, "Using File Manager."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 To start an application from File Manager by using a mouse, do the
 following:

       Mouse 

   1.  Switch to the Main-group window.

   2.  Start File Manager.

   3.  In the Directory Tree window, double-click the name of the directory
       that contains the application you want to start.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   4.  Double-click the program file for the application you want to start.


 If you are using the keyboard, follow these steps to start an application
 from File Manager:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Switch to the Main-group window.

   2.  Start File Manager.

   3.  In the Directory Tree window, press the DIRECTION keys to move to and
       select the name of the directory that contains the application you
       want to start, and then press ENTER to open the directory window.

   4.  In the directory window, press the DIRECTION keys to move to and
       select the program file for the application you want to start, and
       then press ENTER.




 Dragging a Data-File Icon

 Another method for starting an application from File Manager by using a
 mouse is to drag one or more data files onto an application icon or title in
 the group window. Starting an application in this way automatically opens
 the data file with the application. To start an application by dragging a
 data file from File Manager, do the following:

       Mouse 

   1.  Start File Manager from the Main-group window.

   2.  Open the directory containing the data file you want to use.

   3.  Arrange the windows on your screen so that the File Manager directory
       window containing the data file you want to use and the group window
       containing the application you want to start are both visible.

   4.  Select the data file you want to use.

   5.  Using the right mouse button, drag the data-file icon onto the icon or
       title of the application you want to start.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).


 You can start several occurrences of the same application. A separate
 occurrence of the application will start for each data file. If your
 application allows you to work with more than one file at a time, you can
 also start one occurrence of the application with several data files. To
 open several data files and start several occurrences of the application, do
 the following:

       Mouse 

   1.  Select the data files you want to use.

   2.  Using the right mouse button, drag the data-file icons over the icon
       or title of the application you want to start.


 If you want to start only one occurrence of the application, do the
 following:

   ş   Press and hold down ALT while dragging the data-file icons onto the
       icon or title of the application you want to start.


 Some applications do not allow you to open more than one file at a time. For
 these applications, only the first file in your selection is opened. The
 other files are ignored.


 Starting an Application from the MS OS/2 Command Interpreter


 You can also start applications from the MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd. To
 start an application from the MS OS/2 command interpreter, do the following:

   1.  Switch to the Main group and start either OS/2 Full Screen or OS/2
       Window.

   2.  At the MS OS/2 prompt, type the command (and any command-line
       arguments) that starts the application and press ENTER.


 The appearance of your screen will depend on whether your application runs
 in a window or a full screen. If you start a full-screen OS/2 application,
 you see only the application screen. If you start a Presentation Manager
 application or a full-screen OS/2 application that runs in a window, the
 application window appears in front of other windows.

 When you complete your work with a particular application, you can quit the
 application. You can also quit the MS OS/2 command interpreter. To quit the
 MS OS/2 command interpreter, follow these steps:

       Keyboard 

   ş   At the MS OS/2 prompt, type exit and press ENTER.


 Or

   ş   If you are running the MS OS/2 command interpreter in a window, you
       can quit by closing the window.


 If you are using a mouse, do the following to close the MS OS/2
 command-interpreter window:

       Mouse 

   1.  Double-click the System-menu box.

       A message box appears, asking you to confirm your decision to end the
       program and close the window.

   2.  Choose the Yes button.


 If you are using the keyboard, follow these steps to close the MS OS/2
 command-interpreter window:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Press SHIFT+ESC to select the System menu.

   2.  Choose the Close command.

       A message box appears, asking you to confirm your decision to end the
       program and close the window.

   3.  Choose the Yes button.




 Starting a DOS Application from the DOS Session

 In MS OS/2, you can run
 one DOS application at a time in a special environment called the DOS
 sessionÄalmost as if the application were running under DOS on a separate
 computer. You can switch between the DOS session and other MS OS/2
 applications or groups; however, the multitasking capabilities of MS OS/2
 are not available in the DOS session. The DOS session is represented by an
 icon at the bottom of your screen when you start Presentation Manager.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 Because DOS does not allow many of the features used in HPFS names, DOS
 applications may ignore files and directories named using the HPFS naming
 rules. For more information on HPFS filenames and how they are processed by
 DOS applications, see Chapter 16, "Using the High-Performance File System."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 In addition to starting a DOS application from a group window, you can start
 a DOS application directly from the DOS session. To run a DOS application in
 this way, you must first switch to the DOS session. To switch to the DOS
 session, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Double-click the DOS icon.        1  Press CTRL+ESC to display the Task
                                   List.

                                   2  Choose DOS from the list of
                                   applications.


 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 To start a DOS application from the DOS session, do the following:

   ş   At the DOS prompt, type the command (and any command-line arguments)
       that starts the application and press ENTER.


 You can run only one DOS application at a time in the DOS session; however,
 you can switch back to Presentation Manager and use other MS OS/2
 applications without quitting your DOS application. Details on switching
 between applications are provided in the following section.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 You may experience problems with some DOS graphics applications when you
 switch between the DOS session and another session. In some DOS graphics
 applications the screen may not be restored correctly when you return to it
 from another session. If this occurs, close the DOS graphics application
 before switching to another session.

 Switching Between Applications and Program Groups

 After you start more than
 one application or open more than one group window, you need to choose the
 application or group you want to work with and then switch to it. There are
 several ways to accomplish this depending on whether you use a mouse or the
 keyboard.


 Switching Between Visible Applications and Groups

 You can use a mouse to switch quickly between applications or groups that
 are visible on your Presentation Manager screen by doing the following:

       Mouse 

   ş   To switch to an application or group window, click the window.


 Or

   ş   To switch to an application or group running as an icon, double-click
       the icon.


 You can also use the following keyboard technique to switch between
 Presentation Manager windows and icons, full-screen OS/2 applications, and
 the DOS session by doing the following:

       Keyboard 

   ş   Press ALT+ESC until you reach the application or group you want to
       select.


 If you press ALT+ESC to switch to a Presentation Manager application or
 group that is running as an icon, its System menu appears. You must first
 use the Restore command to restore the application or group before you can
 work with it.


 Switching Between Applications and Groups by Using the Task List

 The Task List is used to keep track of your applications and can be used to
 switch quickly between them. You can display the Task List from the DOS
 session or from a full-screen OS/2 application, as well as from Presentation
 Manager.

 The applications you are currently running and the groups that are currently
 open are displayed in the Task List.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 To display the Task List in Presentation Manager, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Position the mouse pointer        Press CTRL+ESC.
 anywhere outside window and
 click the right mouse button.

 You can also display the Task List by using the Switch To command on the
 System menu by doing the following:

   ş   Select the System menu and choose the Switch To command.


 To switch to another application or group, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Double-click the name of the      1  Press the DIRECTION keys to move to
 application or group you want to  and select the name of the application
 switch to.                        or group you want to switch to.

                                   2  Press ENTER.

 You can use the Switch To button in the Task List to switch to a selected
 application or group by doing the following:

   1.  From the Task List, select the application or group you want.

   2.  Choose the Switch To button.


 You can cancel the Task List without switching to an application or group by
 using either a mouse or the keyboard. To cancel the Task List, do the
 following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the screen background       Press ESC.
 (anywhere outside a window).



 Adding an Application to a Program Group

 To make starting applications easier and faster, you can add them to a
 program group by using the New command on the Program menu. This command
 stores the name of your application, its path, and any command arguments in
 the program group. To add an application to a program group, follow these
 steps:

   1.  Switch to the program group you want to add your application to.

   2.  Select the Program menu and choose the New command.

       The New Program dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.

       For details on completing the New Program dialog box, see the
       information following this procedure list.

   4.  To add the application, choose the Add button.


 The following list describes each area of the New Program dialog box:

   ş   In the Program Title box, you type the title of your application. This
       is the name that will appear in the program-group window. You can use
       any name you want, as long as it is unique in the program group.

   ş   In the Path and File Name box, you type the disk-drive letter and a
       colon (:); the path, separating each directory in the path with a
       backslash (\e); and the filename of your application.

       For example, to add the XCOPY.EXE application file on drive C in your
       OS2 directory, you would type the following:

 c:\eos2\excopy.exe




   ş   In the Parameters box, you type any command argumentsÄfor example, a
       filename or an option. Type these arguments just as you would if you
       were typing the command at the MS OS/2 prompt. Argument information is
       optional, but some applications do not run correctly without this
       information.

       When you start an application by dragging a data-file icon onto an
       application icon, the data-file name is the last command argument (by
       default). If you want the data-file name to appear at another place in
       relation to the command arguments, type %* at the correct location. To
       display a dialog box requesting argument information each time you
       start the application, type the request you want displayed, surrounded
       by square brackets ([ ]) in the Parameters box. For example, if you
       want the dialog box to display "Enter your parameters now," you would
       type the following:

 [ your parameters now]




   ş   In the Working Directory box, you type the location of the working
       directoryÄfor example, the directory that contains particular text
       files for a text-editing application.




 Adding a Program File from File Manager

 If you are using a mouse, you can add a program to a group by dragging the
 program-file icon from File Manager onto the group window or group icon. To
 use this method, do the following:

       Mouse 

   1.  Start File Manager from the Main-group window.

   2.  Open the directory containing the program file you want to add.

   3.  Arrange the windows on your screen so that the directory window
       containing the program file you want to add and the group window or
       icon you want to add the program file to are both visible.

   4.  Select the program file you want to add.

   5.  Hold down the right mouse button and drag the program-file icon onto
       the group window or icon.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   6.  Complete the New Program dialog box.




 Changing Application Information

 You can change any information used to start an application by
 using the Properties command on the Program menu. For example, you may want
 to change the working directory for an application or provide an additional
 argument, such as a filename. For full-screen OS/2 applications, you can use
 the Properties command to change whether an application runs in a window or
 in a full screen. To change the information used to start an application,
 follow these steps:

   1.  Switch to the program group containing the application you want.

   2.  Select the application from the group.

   3.  Select the Program menu and choose the Properties command.

       The Properties dialog box appears, displaying the current program
       information.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   4.  Move to the dialog-box area you want to change and type the new
       information.

   5.  Choose the Change button.


 The last section in the dialog box, Program Type, lists two options:
 Presentation Manager and Other. When you start an application, Pre-
 sentation Manager can determine its typeÄPresentation Manager or OtherÄand
 whether the application should run in a window or in a full screen.
 Presentation Manager applications always run in windows.

 Some applications, though, can run in a window or in a full screen,
 depending on what is specified by the application. To change the default
 setting for running your application full-screen or in a window, do the
 following:

   1.  Switch to the program group containing the application you want to
       change.

   2.  Select the application from the group (it cannot be a Presentation
       Manager application).

   3.  Select the Program menu and choose the Properties command.

       The Properties dialog box appears (the Other option in the Program
       Type section is selected).

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   4.  Choose the Change button.

       The How to Run the Program dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   5.  If you want your application to run in a full screen, select the Run
       the Program Full-Screen option. If you want your full-screen OS/2
       application to run in a window, select the Run the Program in a Text
       Window option. If your application is a DOS application, select the
       Run the Program in DOS Mode option. If you want your application to
       determine whether it runs in a window or in a full screen, select the
       Let the Program Decide option. .ET

       If you select the Run the Program in a Text Window option, you can
       also turn on the Close the Window When the Program Ends check box.
       This automatically closes the window when you quit your application.

   6.  Choose the Enter button.

 these steps:

   1.  Switch to Desktop Manager.

   2.  Select the Group menu and choose the New command.

       The New Group dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.  Type the name of the group in the New Group Name box.

   4.  Choose the Add button.


 After you add a new group, Desktop Manager automatically opens the group so
 that you can add or copy applications to it. You add applications by using
 the Add command on the Program menu of the group window. You can also switch
 to another group and copy applications by dragging them with a mouse or by
 using the Copy command. For more information on copying applications from
 one group to another, see "Copying an Application to Another Program Group,"
 earlier in this chapter.


 Changing the List in a Program-Group Window

 When you open a program-group window, the applications in the group are
 represented by title and icon. You can change the list so that only the
 application titles appear in the group window.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 You change the way the contents of a group window are displayed by using the
 Text and Icon commands on the View menu. To display only application titles

 Working with a Full-Screen OS/2 Application in a Window

 Many full-screen OS/2 applications can run in a window even though they are
 not specifically designed as Presentation Manager applications. Running an
 application in a window gives you many of the advantages of a Presentation
 Manager application: you can size the window, you can use a mouse to switch
 to the application, and you have easy access to other applications. For
 information on how to make a full-screen OS/2 application run in a window,
 see "Changing Application Information," earlier in this chapter.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 .ET You can select the System menu from a full-screen OS/2 application
 running in a window by doing the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the System-menu box.        Press ALT or SHIFT+ESC.


 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 .RT


 Using Help

 Help information is available on running an application in a window;
 however, you get Help information for a full-screen OS/2 application running
 in a window in a different way than you get it for a regular Presentation
 Manager application. To get Help information on running a full-screen OS/2
 application in a window, do the following:

   ş   Select the System menu and choose the Help command.

       The Help window appears.



 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 The Help window itself is a Presentation Manager window and works in the
 same way that other Presentation Manager windows work. You can close the
 Help window by doing the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Double-click the System-menu box.  Press ESC.



 Switching Between Applications and Program Groups

 You can switch to another application or program group from a full-screen
 OS/2 application running in a window the same way you switch from an
 application running in Presentation Manager: by clicking in another window,
 by pressing ALT+ESC or ALT+TAB to move to the next application or window, or
 by clicking the right mouse button outside a window or pressing CTRL+ESC to
 display the Task List. In addition, the Switch Window command on the System
 menu lets you switch to another application or group. To switch to another
 application or group by using the Switch Window command, do the following:

   ş   Select the System menu and choose the Switch Window command.




 Reducing the Text Size

 To display more information in a window, you can reduce the size of the text
 displayed in a full-screen OS/2 application running in a window. To reduce
 the size of text characters, do the following:

   ş   Select the System menu and choose the Small Font command.

       In the System menu, the Small Font command, once it is chosen, is
       replaced by the Large Font command.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).


 To restore the text characters to their original size, do the following:

   ş   Select the System menu and choose the Large Font command.




 Scrolling a Window

 When you are running a full-screen OS/2 application in a window, you may not
 be able to see all of the information at one time. You can scroll the
 contents of the window to see more information by using either the scroll
 bars or the Scroll command on the System menu. To scroll a window by using a
 mouse, do the following:

       Mouse 

   ş   Click the scroll bars at the side or bottom of the window.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

       in effect (a check mark also appears next to the Scroll command on the
       System menu).

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   2.  Press the DIRECTION keys to scroll the window.

   3.  After you complete the scrolling, select the System menu and choose
       the Scroll command again.




 Sizing a Window


 You change the size of the window for a full-screen OS/2 application running
 in a window in much the same way you change the size of Presentation Manager
 application windows: by using a mouse or by choosing the Size, Minimize,
 Maximize, or Restore commands on the System menu. These commands work a
 little differently, however, in full-screen OS/2 application windows. To
 size a full-screen OS/2 application window by using a mouse, follow these
 steps: .ET
       Mouse 

   1.  Point to the border or corner that you want to move (the mouse pointer
       becomes a two-headed arrow).

   2.  Drag the corner or border until the window is the size you want.


 .RT To size a full-screen OS/2 application window by using the keyboard,
 follow these steps:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Select the System menu and choose the Size command.

   2.  Press one DIRECTION key to select the border you want to move.

   3.  Press the DIRECTION keys to move the border until the window is the
       size you want.

   4.  Press ENTER.


 If you choose the Small Font command, the window becomes smaller. The same
 amount of information is displayed but the character size is reduced.

 You can enlarge a full-screen OS/2 application window to fill most of your
 screen. However, the icon area remains visible on your screen. If you choose
 the Small Font command, the maximum size of the window is reduced. When you
 enlarge a full-screen OS/2 application window, the scroll bars disappear. To
 enlarge a full-screen OS/2 application window to its maximum size, do the
 following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the Maximize box.           Select the System menu and choose the
                                   Maximize command.

 To reduce a full-screen OS/2 application window to an icon, do the
 following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the Minimize box.           Select the System menu and choose the
                                   Minimize command.

 When you reduce a full-screen OS/2 application to an icon, the OS/2 Window
 icon appears at the bottom of your screen.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 Running Utility Programs

 MS OS/2 utilities are programs you can use to accomplish common tasks such
 as formatting floppy disks, making backup copies of floppy disks, and
 checking available storage space on disks. How you start a utility depends
 on the task you want to accomplish. For example, if you want to provide
 additional information, such as a filename, when you start a utility, you
 should start the MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd, and start the utility
 from the MS OS/2 command line. On the other hand, if MS OS/2 does not need
 any additional information in order to run the utility correctly, you should
 start it from File Manager. If you use a utility frequently, you may want to
 add it to a program group.


 Some MS OS/2 utilities have already been added to the Utilities group. The
 following list briefly describes each utility:
 Utility                           Description

 Introduction

 This chapter explains File Manager, a Presentation Manager application that
 you can use to quickly look at and organize your directories and files. From
 the Directory Tree window you can see the overall directory structure, as
 well as the contents of individual directories. You use File Manager
 commands to copy, delete, or rename files.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 All examples of filenames and directory names in this chapter use the file
 allocation table (FAT) file system, which is the file system used by DOS and
 MS OS/2 versions 1.1 and earlier. For information on using high-performance
 file system (HPFS) filenames and directory names, see Chapter 16, "Using the
 High-Performance File System."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Starting File Manager

 File Manager is a Presentation Manager application and is started from the
 Main group in Desktop Manager. To start File Manager, do the following:

   1.  Switch to the Main-group window.

   2.  Choose File Manager.


 File Manager appears on your screen with the Directory Tree win- dow
 displayed in the work area. The Directory Tree window is used to see the
 layout of your directories and subdirectories on any disk drive. From this
 window, you can open windows to look at files and subdirectories in
 individual directories. You can select different drives in order to look at
 their directory structure. You can open as many directory windows as you
 like; however, there is only one Directory Tree window. The following
 example shows the Directory Tree window.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 The MS OS/2 multilevel file system resembles a tree. The tree begins with
 the root directoryÄthe name of the first directory on the disk drive. The
 root directory is created when you format a disk. It appears as a backslash
 (\e).

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).


 The branches of the tree are the directories you create from the root
 directory. Each directory can contain additional directories.
 The Directory Tree window contains the following parts:

   ş   The System-menu box in the upper-left corner of the Directory Tree
       window contains commands you use to move and size the window and to
       move to other windows in File Manager.

   ş   The disk-drive icons represent disk drives on your computer. The
       current disk drive is highlighted. A drive letter and a colon (:)
       represent a disk drive. The current drive is listed at the top of the
       Directory Tree window.

   ş   The directory icons represent each directory on a disk. Directories
       are listed in alphabetical order beneath the root directory (\e). All
       directories are joined to the root directory by a vertical line. If a
       directory contains subdirectories, there is a minus sign inside the
       directory icon. Subdirectories appear beneath directories, connected
       by a vertical line.

   ş   The current directory is the directory marked by the selection cursor
       in the Directory Tree window. File Manager commands affect this
       directory.

   ş   The path appears in the status line underneath the drive icons and
       shows the current directory in the Directory Tree window.

   ş   The volume label is a name that identifies your disk; it appears in
       the status line underneath the drive icons. You see this information
       only if you give your disk a volume label.

   ş   Scroll bars appear if there are more directories and subdirectories
       than will fit in one Directory Tree window.


 The Directory Tree window resembles an application window in Presentation
 Manager. You can size and move this window in the File Manager work area.
 You can enlarge it to fill the entire File Manager work area, or you can
 reduce it to an icon.


 Changing Disk Drives

 When you start File Manager, the Directory Tree window shows the directory
 structure on the current disk driveÄthe disk drive on which you are working.
 The selected disk-drive icon represents the current disk drive.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 To look at directories on another disk drive, you must select the disk
 drive, which then becomes the current disk drive. To select a disk drive, do
 the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Double-click the disk-drive icon.  Press and hold down CTRL, and then press
                                   the letter of the disk drive you want.



 Changing Directories in the Directory Tree Window

 In the Directory Tree window, shown in the following example, the selection
 cursor shows the current directory.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 You can select only one directory at a time in this window. To change to a
 different directory, you move the selection cursor. To move the selection
 cursor by using a mouse, do the following:

       Mouse 

   ş   Click the directory name.


 To select a directory by using the keyboard, do the following:

       Keyboard 

   ş   Press the UP or DOWN key.


 The following list describes several additional keys or key combinations you
 can use to move and select in the Directory Tree window.

 To select                         Press
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Root directory                    CTRL+HOME

 Last directory listed             CTRL+END

 First subdirectory of a selected  RIGHT
 directory, if one exists

 Next directory level up from a    LEFT
 selected directory, if one
 exists

 Directory one window up from a    PAGE UP
 selected directory

 Directory one window down from a  PAGE DOWN
 selected directory

 Directory name or filename        Initial letter



 Opening a Directory Window

 The Directory Tree window
 shows you the overall structure of your directories. To see the contents of
 a directory, you must open a directory window.

 Directory windows open in front of the Directory Tree window. All the files
 and any subdirectories are displayed. The disk drive and path appear at the
 top of the window in the title bar. The directory path shows the location of
 the directory in relation to the root directory; directory names are
 separated by backslashes (\e). From the directory window, you can open
 additional windows on any of the directories displayed. To open a directory
 window, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 In the Directory Tree window or   1  In the Directory Tree window or the
 the directory window,             directory window, press the UP or DOWN
 double-click the directory name.  key to move to and select the directory
                                   you want to open.

                                   2  Press ENTER.


 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 Files and directories are distinguished by the following icons in File
 Manager windows:

 Icon                              Description
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

                                   A program-file icon. Files that contain
                                   programs, such as applications or batch
                                   files, are called program files.

                                   A data-file icon. Other files, such as
                                   text files, are called data files.

                                   A directory icon. Directories appear at
                                   the top of lists of files.

                                   A parent-directory icon. The first
                                   directory icon contains an arrow. This
                                   represents the directory one level
                                   upÄthe parent directoryÄfrom the current
                                   directory. The name of the parent
                                   directory appears inside brackets (< >).
                                   All directories have a parent directory
                                   except the root directory.

 Other icons may appear in a directory window. Some applications create
 customized icons to represent program files or different types of data files
 created by the application. For example, a program that includes both
 spreadsheet and graphics features may have a special icon to identify the
 program file, a different icon to identify charts created with the
 application, and another icon to identify worksheets.

 You can change the way directory and file information is displayed in
 directory windows by using the commands on the View menu. These commands are
 described in the section "Changing Information in the Directory Window,"
 later in this chapter.


 Selecting in a Directory Window

 In
 directory windows, you must select directories and files before you can use
 most File Manager commands.

 .RT To select a window by using the Window menu, do the following:

   1.  Select the Window menu.

   2.  Choose the window you want.




 Using File Manager Commands


 Before you start working with File Manager commands, you should become
 familiar with MS OS/2 naming conventions for files, directories, and disk
 drives. Although with File Manager you can use the selection cursor to
 select files, directories, or disk drives, you may occasionally need to type
 the names for these itemsÄfor example, in a dialog box or while you are
 working with the MS OS/2 command interpreter (cmd).

 Naming a File or Directory

 The rules you follow to name your files and directories depend on which file
 system you are using. The file system is the part of the operating system
 that controls how files and directories are orga- nized, stored, and
 retrieved on your computer.

 Two file systems are provided with MS OS/2: the high-performance file system
 (HPFS) and the file allocation table (FAT) file system. HPFS is a new file
 system that can be set up only on your hard disk; the FAT file system was
 used in DOS and earlier versions of MS OS/2. You can format both hard disks
 and floppy disks to use the FAT file system. If you formatted your hard disk
 when you set up MS OS/2 on your computer, you were given a choice of which
 file system you wanted to install on your hard disk. To change the file
 system you are currently using or for more details on how to set up HPFS,
 see Chapter 16, "Using the High-Performance File System."

 One of the main differences between the FAT file system and HPFS is in how
 you name files and directories. If you are using HPFS, you should be
 familiar with both FAT and HPFS naming rules because floppy disks cannot be
 formatted for HPFS. If you are familiar with DOS or previous versions of MS
 OS/2, you have used the FAT file system. Filenames and directory names can
 be up to eight characters long. You can add an extension, three additional
 characters, to a filename or directory name, but these must be separated
 from the name by a period (.). Often, applications automatically add
 extensions when you create files.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 In HPFS, filenames can be up to 254 characters long. The period (.) is a
 valid filename character, and you can use as many as you like in a filename.
 The following characters can also be used in HPFS:

  , + = [ ] ;


 Blank spaces can also be used anywhere in a filename or directory name.
 There is no requirement that filenames have extensions; however, many
 applications still create and use them.

 The case you give to HPFS filenames will be preserved for directory
 listings; you can have a file that is all uppercase, all lowercase, or mixed
 case, and it will be listed as you typed it. However, case is ignored in
 file searches and all system operations other than directory listings.
 Therefore, in a given directory, you cannot have more than one file with the
 same name where the only difference is case. For example, you cannot have
 files in the same directory named "my.taxfile.txt" and "MY.TAXFILE.TXT". For
 more information on HPFS file-naming rules, see Chapter 16, "Using the
 High-Performance File System."

 All FAT filenames are valid in HPFS. Floppy disks use the FAT file system
 only, so long filenames created in HPFS must be shortened when you move or
 copy these files to floppy disks. The Move and Copy commands in File Manager
 detect the file-system format of a disk and provide short names for your
 files (for more information on this process, see "Transferring Files Between
 File Systems," later in this chapter). HPFS filenames that contain
 characters or blank spaces not allowed in the FAT file system cannot be
 moved or copied to floppy disks. If you attempt to do so, you will see a
 message stating that the filename contains an incorrect character. You must
 change the filename before moving or copying the file. In the DOS session,
 the FAT naming rules apply: Filenames are limited to eight characters with
 three-character extensions. You cannot use files with long HPFS filenames
 with your DOS applications. These long filenames do not appear in directory
 listings in the DOS session.

 The following characters cannot be used in directory names or filenames
 regardless of the file system you have set up because they are reserved for
 MS OS/2:

 < > : " / \e |


 Wildcard characters\, the question mark (?) and asterisk (*), have special
 meaning. These characters can take the place of other characters when you
 are specifying filenames in File ManagerÄfor example, when copying files
 from one directory to another.

 The question mark (?) replaces any single characterÄfor example, AUG?
 matches the files AUGU, AUG, and AUG1.

 The asterisk (*) replaces zero or more characters in a filename and matches
 any character; for example, AUG* matches any filename that begins with AUG,
 as well as filenames such as AUGUST.DOC, AUGUSTFIRST, or simply AUG.

 If you are using MS OS/2 commands such as copy or dir, the wildcard
 characters can function differently depending on the command. For more
 information, see Chapter 8, "Running Cmd."


 Specifying a File Location

 When you are using commands in File Manager,
 you can specify the exact location of a file or directory. This is called
 giving the path. The path includes all of the directory information MS OS/2
 needs to find a particular file. A path has the following form:

 [\edirectory...][\edirectory...]\edirectory


 The information inside the square brackets ([ ]) is optional, indicating
 that you could have more than one directory in a path. Each directory name
 is separated by a backslash (\e). The first backslash represents the root
 directory. You specify a path with a filename only if the file is not in the
 current directory. A path is shown in the following example.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 You add a disk-drive designation to a path if you are working with files and
 directories on different disk drives. The disk-drive designation has the
 following form:

 drive:


 The following example shows the drive designation, path, and filename of a
 fileÄthe PASTDUE.DOC file in the ACCOUNTS directory on drive A will be
 copied to the COLLECTION directory on drive C.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 Changing Information in the Directory Tree Window

 You can control the amount of directory information shown in the Directory
 Tree window by using the Tree menu commands.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 When you first start File Manager, the entire directory structure is shown.
 All directories and subdirectories are listed in the Directory Tree window.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).



 Collapsing a Directory Level

 A minus sign (-) appears next to any directory that contains a subdirectory.
 You use the minus signs to "collapse," or hide, individual subdirectories.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 Once a directory is collapsed, only the directory name is displayed; the
 minus sign changes to a plus sign (+) to indicate the hidden subdirectories.


 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 To collapse a directory level by using a mouse, do the following:

       Mouse 

   ş   Click the minus sign (-) to the left of the name of the directory you
       want to collapse.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).


 To collapse a directory level by using the keyboard, do the following:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Press the DIRECTION keys to move to and select the directory you want
       to collapse.

   2.  Select the Tree menu and choose the Collapse Branch command, or press
       - (minus key or hyphen key).




 Expanding a Directory

 You can expand a directory to see its
 subdirectories. To expand a directory, follow this step:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the plus sign (+) next to   1  Press the DIRECTION keys to move to
 the directory you want to expand.  and select the directory you want to
                                   expand.

                                   2  Select the Tree menu and choose the
                                   Expand One Level command, or press +
                                   (plus key).

 Another command on the Tree menu, Expand Branch, is used to show all
 directory levels beneath a selected directory.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 Follow these steps to use the Expand Branch command:

   1.  Select the directory you want to expand.

   2.  Select the Tree menu and choose the Expand Branch command.


 To display all the directory levels in the Directory Tree window at once, do
 the following:

   ş   Select the Tree menu and choose the Expand All command.




 Changing Information in a Directory Window


 When you first start File Manager and open a directory window, files are
 listed by filename and are sorted in alphabetical order. The commands on the
 View menu, shown in the following example, are used to change and control
 how the files and directories appear in directory windows. You can choose to
 display just the filenames, or just file and directory icons, or complete
 file information. You can also sort files and can include or omit different
 types of files from the directory listings.
 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 If the Directory Tree window is the active File Manager window when you use
 a command on the View menu, all directory windows you open afterward will be
 affected (directory windows already open remain unchanged). If a directory
 window is active, the command usually affects only that window. However,
 three commands on the View menuÄOther, Sort By, and IncludeÄhave an option
 called Set System Default. If you select this option when using one of these
 commands, any choices you make in the dialog box become default settings and
 any directory windows you open afterward will be affected.


 Changing the File Listing


 You can change how file information appears in directory windows by using the
 Name, File Details, Icon, or Other commands on the View menu. A check mark
 appears next to the command when it is in effect. These commands are grouped
 together on the View menu because one must be in effect at all times. When
 you first start File Manager, the Name command is checked. This means that
 only filenames and directory names appear in a directory window.
 The following list summarizes the effect of each command on the directory
 window:

 Command                           Displays
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Name                              Filenames and directory names

 File Details                      Complete file and directory information

 Icon                              Files and directories as icons (names
                                   appear underneath)

 Other                             Selected file information

 The icon view of a directory window is a graphic presentation of file
 information. Icons that usually appear next to a filename or directory name
 are enlarged, and the name appears underneath, as shown in the following
 example.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 To display directory information as icons, do the following:

   1.  Select the directory window you want to change (to change all the
       directory windows, select the Directory Tree window).

   2.  Select the View menu and choose the Icon command.


 The File Details command on the View menu lets you see file information such
 as file size, the date and time the file was last changed, and the file
 flags (for example, Read-only and Archive) for all files in a particular
 directory. To view all file information in a directory window, do the
 following:

   1.  Select the directory window you want to change (to change all the
       directory windows, select the Directory Tree window).

   2.  Select the View menu and choose the File Details command.


 Once you choose the File Details command, the window splits vertically. The
 filename appears on the left; file details appear on the rightÄfor example,
 size, last modification date, and the file flags.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 Splitting a directory window makes it possible to view long filenames. (If
 you set up the high-performance file system on the disk drive, file- names
 can be up to 254 characters long.) You can use the scroll bars at the bottom
 of the window to look at information not visible, or you can reposition the
 split bar. To move the split bar, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Drag the split bar to the         1  Select the directory window System
 position you want.                menu by pressing CTRL+ - (hyphen key)
                                   and choose the Split command (the Split
                                   command is added to the System menu when
                                   you choose File Details).

                                   2  Press the RIGHT or LEFT key to move
                                   the border to the position you want and
                                   press ENTER.

 The procedure for selecting files in a split window is the same as in any
 other window; however, you can also select either side of the window. The
 selection cursor moves from one side to the other, depending on the side you
 select. To move the selection cursor, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Click the side of the window you  Press F6.
 want to select.

 You can select which file details appear in the directory listing by using
 the Other command on the View menu. The directory window splits, as with the
 File Details command, and the file details you select appear in columns in
 the right side of the window.

 If the Directory Tree window is active when you choose the Other command,
 the settings you create with the command become the system default settings.
 If a directory window is active, then the settings affect only the active
 window. An option is provided, Set System Default, so that you can create
 new system default settings from a directory window as well as from the
 Directory Tree window. If you use this option, only the active window and
 any new windows you open will display default settings. Directory windows
 that are already open remain unchanged. To control which file details appear
 in a directory listing, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the window you want to change.

   2.  Select the View menu and choose the Other command.

       The View Other dialog box appears.

   3.  Select the file details you want in your directory listing. For more
       information on completing this dialog box, see the information
       following this procedure.

   4.  Turn on the Set System Default check box if you want the settings to
       become the default settings and affect other directory windows you
       open (directory windows that are already open remain unchanged).

   5.  Choose the View Now button (if the Directory Tree window is active,
       choose the Set View button).



 You can choose to display one or all of the following file details:
 Option                            Displays
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Size                              File or directory size (in bytes)

 Last Modification Date            Date the file or directory was last
                                   changed

 Last Access Date                  Date the file was last opened

 Creation Date                     Date the file was created

 File Flags                        Information on the file flags set for
                                   the file (R for Read-only, A for Archive,
                                   H for Hidden)



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 The creation date and last access date information is available only in the
 high-performance file system (HPFS). If your disk drive is formatted with
 the file allocation table (FAT) file system, this information is not
 displayed.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Sorting a File Listing

 You can control how file information in a directory window is sorted by
 using three commands on the View menu: By Name, By Type, and Sort By.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 A check mark appears next to the command that is in effect. These commands
 are grouped together because one of them must be in effect at all times.

 When you first start File Manager, the By Name command is checked. This
 means that files and directories appear in alphabetical order. Directories
 always appear first in the listingÄthe first directory is the parent
 directory (the directory one level up). The root directory does not have a
 parent directory.

 If the Directory Tree
 window is active when you choose a sort command, the settings you create
 with the command become the system default settings. If a directory window
 is active, then the settings affect only the active window. The Sort By
 command includes an option, Set System Default, so that you can create new
 system default settings from a directory window as well as from the
 Directory Tree window. If you use this option, only the active window and
 new windows you open will display default settings. Directory windows that
 are already open remain unchanged.

 You can sort files according to file type. This means that files are sorted
 alphabetically according to their extensionÄthe last three characters of the
 filename (for example, filenames ending with .CMD, would appear before
 filenames ending with .EXE). You can also sort files based on other file
 information, such as the date a file was created. Using the Sort By command,
 you can sort files in the following ways:

 Option                            Sorts files
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Name                              Alphabetically by name

 Type                              Alphabetically by extension

 Size                              By size (largest file first)

 Last Modification Date            By date and time each file was last
                                   changed

 Last Access Date                  By date and time each file was last
                                   accessed

 Creation Date                     By the date and time each file was
                                   created

 The file information about creation date and last access date is available
 only if you installed the high-performance file system (HPFS) on your disk.
 If the disk is formatted with the file allocation table (FAT) file system
 and you specify Last Access Date or Creation Date, then files are sorted by
 name. To change how files are sorted, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the directory window that contains the files you want to sort.
       If you select the Directory Tree window, the sorting order becomes the
       default order for the windows you open afterward.

   2.  Select the View menu and choose the Sort By command.

       The Sort By dialog box appears.

   3.  In the Sort box, select the sorting order you want.

   4.  Turn on the Set System Default check box if you want the settings to
       become the default settings and affect other directory windows you
       open (directory windows that are already opened remain unchanged).

   5.  Choose the View Now button (if the Directory Tree window is active,
       choose the Set View button).


 You can use the By Name and By Type commands as shortcuts to sorting files
 alphabetically by name (the default setting) or alphabetically by the
 filename extension. To quickly sort files by name or type, do the following:


   1.  Select the directory window.

   2.  Select the View menu and choose the By Name command to sort files by
       name; choose the By Type command to sort files alphabetically by
       filename extension.




 Including a File in a File Listing

 You can control which files and directories appear in a directory window by
 using the Include command on the View menu. By default, all files and
 directories are included when you open a window. You can include or omit
 files from the directory window according to type (directory, program, or
 data file).

 The Include command allows you to display the following files:

   ş   Directories

   ş   Program files (identified by a extension)

   ş   Data files (files other than program files and directories)


 You can also include or omit files according to their file flags (file flags
 are part of the directory information that identifies a file to MS OS/2).
 Because files often have more than one file flag set, the Include command
 lets you select a group of files with matching flags, and within that group
 of files, omit or keep files with other file flags.

 You can display files according to the following file flags:

 Flag                              Description
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Read-only                         Files that cannot be edited or changed

 Archive                           Files that have been backed up or copied
                                   using MS OS/2 utilities such as backup
                                   and xcopy

 Hidden                            Files that do not appear in directory
                                   listings

 Other                             Directories or files with no flags set

 If the Directory Tree window is active when you choose the Include command,
 the settings you create with the command become the system default settings.
 If a directory window is active, then the settings affect only the active
 window. An option, Set System Default, is provided so that you can create
 new system default settings from a directory window, as well as from the
 Directory Tree window. If you use this option, only the active window and
 new windows you open will display default settings. Directory windows that
 are already open remain unchanged. To change the files that appear in a
 directory window, following these steps:

   1.  Select the View menu and choose the Include command.

       The Include dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   2.  You can view files according to filename. The default is *, indicating
       that all files will appear. To specify a different filename, type the
       new name in the Name box. You can use the wildcard characters, * and
       ?, to specify portions of filenames.

   3.  Move to the File Type section and turn on the check boxes for the
       types of files you want to appear in the directory window:
       directories, programs, or data files. You can choose more than one.

   4.  Move to the File Flags section.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   5.  For each file flag, select the option you want. You have three
       options: Show, But Omit, But Keep.

       The Show option creates a group of files with the file flags you
       select. The But Omit option checks the group of files and removes any
       files with that particular flag set. The But Keep option checks the
       group of files and keeps any files with that particular flag set.

   6.  Select the Set System Default option if you want the settings to
       become the default settings and affect any other directory win- dows
       you open (directory windows that are already open remain unchanged).

   7.  Choose the View Now button (if the Directory Tree window is active,
       choose the Set View button).




 Updating a File Manager Window

 As you use File Manager commands to organize and manage your files, the
 information in directory windows may become out-of-date or inaccurate. You
 can use the Refresh command on the Window menu to update your directory
 windows or the icons representing your programs.

 You can choose to refresh only directory windows or only the icons that
 represent your programs, or you can choose to refresh both at the same time.
 To use the Refresh command, do the following: .ET

   1.  Select the Window menu and choose the Refresh command.

       The Refresh dialog box appears.

   2.  Turn on the Refresh Contents check box to update your directory
       windows; turn on the Refresh Icons check box to update your program
       icons.

   3.  Choose the Refresh button.

   5.  Choose the Set button.




 Reducing a File Manager Window to an Icon

 You can reduce a File Manager window to an icon when you have finished
 working with it but want it available for later use. The directory is still
 open (represented by an icon at the bottom of the File Manager work area).
 You can select and move icons on your screen the same way you select and
 move windows. You can also move or copy files or directories by using the
 mouse, just as if the window were open. When you want to see the contents of
 the window, you can use the Maximize or Restore command to enlarge it. To

 Arranging Windows in File Manager

 File Manager has two commands on the Window menu you can use to organize
 windows on your screen: Tile and Cascade. These commands arrange File
 Manager windows the same way the Tile All and Cascade All commands in
 Desktop Manager arrange application windows.

 The Tile command arranges windows side by side so that each
 window is visible. None of the windows overlap. .RT

 The Cascade command arranges windows so that they overlap, starting in the
 upper-left corner of the File Manager work area. The title bar of each
 window remains visible. To use the Cascade or Tile command, do the
 following:

   ş   Select the Window menu and choose either the Cascade or Tile command.




 Creating a Directory

 You can create new directories by using the Create Directory command: Create
 a subdirectory of the current directory (if the Directory Tree window is
 active, the current directory is the selected directory), or create a
 directory in a different location by typing the path of the new directory in
 a dialog box. To use the Create Directory command, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the File menu and choose the Create Directory command.

       The Create Directory dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).
 The current directory is shown in the dialog box.

   2.  To create a subdirectory of the current directory, type the name in
       the New Directory Name box; to create a directory in a different
       location, type the complete path (for example, \e1990\ebooks).

   3.  Choose the Create button.


 You can copy files into a directory by using the Move or Copy commands on
 the File menu, or you can create files by using your applications. For more
 information on these commands, see the sections later in this chapter.


 Deleting a File or Directory

 You can delete a file or directory by using the Delete command on the File
 menu. Deleting a directory also deletes any files or directories in the
 directory. To delete a file or directory, do the following:

   1.  Select the file or directory you want to delete in the File Manager
       window (in the Directory Tree window, you can delete only
       directories).

   2.  Select the File menu and choose the Delete command.

       The Delete dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 The selected file or directory is displayed.
   3.  Choose the Delete button.

       A dialog box appears, confirming that you want to delete the directory
       or file.

   4.  Choose the Yes button to complete the command; choose the No button to
       cancel the command.


 Two check boxes in the Delete dialog box are used to turn off the warning
 messages that appear when you delete files or directories. The default
 setting is to display warning messages. The Confirm on Delete message
 confirms the name of each file you delete. The Confirm on Subtree Delete
 message confirms that you want to delete a directory and its contents. The
 message settings you make when using the Delete command affect only the
 particular files or directories you are deleting. To change whether these
 messages are displayed by default, use the Confirma- tion command on the
 Options menu. For more information on the Confirmation command, see "Turning
 Off a Confirmation Message," later in this chapter.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 You cannot delete some MS OS/2 files. If you attempt to delete an MS OS/2
 system file or a file that an application is using, you receive a message
 that the file cannot be deleted at the present time. Because MS OS/2 is a
 multitasking system, it protects you from deleting files that other programs
 are using and from deleting important system files, such as the OS2.INI file
 or the program files that are part of the operating system.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Moving a File or Directory


 You can move a file or directory by dragging it with a mouse or by using the
 Move command on the File menu. You can move the file or directory to a
 directory in the Directory Tree window, to another directory window, to a
 directory icon, or to a disk-drive icon. If you are moving directories or
 files by using a mouse, both the items you move and the destination (the
 window or icon) must be visible.
 For more information on moving files from one file system to another (for
 example, from HPFS to the FAT file system), see "Transferring Files Between
 File Systems," later in this chapter. To move a file or directory to a
 location on the same disk drive by using a mouse, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the File Manager window that contains the file or directory you
       want to move. If you are moving a directory, you can select the
       Directory Tree window.

   2.  Select the file or directory in the window.

   3.  Using the right mouse button, drag the file or directory icon to the
       destination directory.

       A dialog box appears, displaying the file or directory that is being
       moved and the destination directory.

   4.  If you are moving a directory, a dialog box appears, asking you to
       confirm the move. Choose the Yes button.


 To move a file or directory to a different disk drive by using a mouse, do
 the following:

       Mouse 

   1.  Select the File Manager window that contains the file or directory you
       want to move. If you are moving a directory, you can select the
       Directory Tree window.

   2.  Select the file or directory in the window.

   3.  Press and hold down ALT and, using the right mouse button, drag the
       file or directory to the appropriate disk drive (the disk-drive icon
       at the top of the Directory Tree window or any open window on a disk
       drive).

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).
 A dialog box appears, confirming the move.

   4.  If you are moving a directory, a dialog box appears, asking you if you
       want to move the directory and any files in it. Choose the Yes button.


 To move a file or directory by using the keyboard, follow these steps:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the file or directory you
       want to move. If you are moving a directory, you can select the
       Directory Tree window.

   2.  Select the file or directory you want to move.

   3.  Select the File menu and choose the Move command.

       The Move dialog box, shown in the following example, appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).
 The file or directory appears in the From box.

   4.  Type the destination directory in the To box.

   5.  Choose the Move button.


 You can move more than one file or directory at a time by extending your
 selection in the directory window; however, in the Directory Tree window,
 you can select only one directory at a time. For more information on
 extending a selection in a directory window, see "Selecting in a Directory
 Window," earlier in this chapter. If you are moving more than one file or
 directory, the destination should be a directory rather than a file. If you
 move more than one item to a file, File Manager attempts to replace the file
 with each item you are moving. If you are moving multiple files or
 directories using the Move dialog box, start each filename or directory name
 on a new line in the From box (press ENTER to start each new line).

 The Confirm on Replace check box in the Move dialog box is used to turn off
 the warning message that appears before you overwrite an existing file or
 directory. Turning off this check box affects only that particular move
 operation. To change whether the Confirm on Replace message is displayed by
 default, use the Confirmation command on the Options menu. For more
 information on the Confirmation command, see "Turning Off a Confirmation
 Message," later in this chapter.

   2.  Select the file or directory in the window.

   3.  Using the right mouse button, drag the file or directory icon to the
       destination directory.

       A dialog box appears, confirming the copy.

   4.  If you are copying a directory, a dialog box appears, asking you if
       you want to copy the directory and any files in it. Choose the Yes
       button.


 Follow these steps to copy a file or directory by using the keyboard:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the file or directory you
       want to copy. If you are copying a directory, you can select the
       Directory Tree window.

   5.  Choose the Copy button.


 You can copy more than one file or directory at a time to a destination
 directory by extending your selection in the directory window; however, in
 the Directory Tree window, you can select only one directory at a time. For
 more information on extending a selection in a directory window, see
 "Selecting in a Directory Window," earlier in this chapter.

 If you are copying multiple files or directories using the Copy dialog box,
 start each filename on a new line in the From box (press ENTER to start each
 new line). .ET


 Transferring Files Between File Systems

 If you installed the high-performance file system (HPFS) on a disk drive on
 your hard disk, you may need to move some of your files to a disk drive
 formatted with the file allocation table (FAT) file system. Because the FAT
 file system supports only eight-character filenames .RT with three-character
 file extensions, filenames longer than this must be shortened when
 transferred to a FAT-formatted disk. (Filenames that contain characters or
 blank spaces not allowed in the FAT file system are invisible to the FAT
 file system. You cannot copy or move these files to a FAT-formatted disk
 without changing their names.)

 When you transfer files using File Manager, either by using a mouse or by
 using the Copy and Move commands, long filenames are automatically shortened
 as follows:

   ş   The base of the name is the first eight characters or the characters
       up to the last period, whichever limit is encountered first.

   ş   Any periods in the base of the name are converted to underscores (_).

   ş   The first three characters after the last period become the filename
       extension. (If there is no period in the long filename, the proposed
       filename has no extension.)


 When you transfer the file back to HPFS using File Manager, the original
 long filename is restored.

 Using the Confirmation command on the Options menu, you can turn on
 confirmation messages that allow you to edit a proposed short filename or
 change a restored long filename. If the confirmation message is turned on, a
 dialog box appears, proposing a short filename each time you use File
 Manager to transfer files from HPFS to the FAT file system. You can edit the
 proposed name.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 When you use File Manager to transfer a file back to HPFS, a dialog box
 appears, asking if you want to restore the original long filename. You can
 accept the proposed name, or choose to keep the shortened name. To turn on
 the confirmation messages, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the Options menu and choose the Confirmation command.

       The Confirmations dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   2.  Turn on the Confirm New Name of All Transferred Files check box. A
       dialog box will be displayed each time you transfer a file from HPFS
       to the FAT file system.

   3.  Turn on the Confirm Restored Name of All Transferred Files check box.
       A dialog box will be displayed each time you move a file with a long
       filename from the FAT file system to HPFS.

   4.  Choose the Set button.




 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 Earlier versions of MS OS/2 (1.1 or earlier) and DOS (ver- sions 4.1 or
 earlier) do not support the extended attribute feature of MS OS/2. If you
 copy or move a file with extended attributes to a file system that does not
 support extended attributes, a message will appear telling you that the
 extended attributes will be discarded. If the file requires the extended
 attributes, MS OS/2 will not copy the file, and will display a message
 telling you that the extended attributes cannot be copied. If you are
 transferring files to the FAT file system for use on a computer running DOS
 or an earlier version of MS OS/2, you can use the MS OS/2 eautil utility to
 ensure that extended-attribute information for your files is saved. See the
 eautil entry in the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference for more
 information.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Renaming a File or Directory

 You can rename a file or directory by using the Rename command on the File
 menu. To rename a file or directory, do the following:

   1.  Select the File Manager window that contains the file or directory you
       want to rename. If you are renaming a directory, you can select the
       Directory Tree window.

   2.  Select the file or directory you want to rename (you should rename
       only one file or directory at a time).

   3.  Select the File menu and choose the Rename command.

       The Rename dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).
 The file or directory you selected appears in the From box.

   4.  Type the new name in the To box.

   5.  Choose the Rename button.


 The Confirm on Replace check box in the Rename dialog box is used to turn
 off the warning message that appears before you overwrite an existing file
 or directory with the Rename command. Turning off the check box affects only
 that particular rename operation. To change whether the Confirm on Replace
 message is displayed by default, use the Confirmation command on the Options
 menu. For more information on the Confirmation command, see "Turning Off a
 Confirmation Message," later in this chapter.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 In the high-performance file system (HPFS), you can use the Rename command
 to change the case of a filename or directory name. For example, to change
 the file "my.taxfile.txt" to "MY.TAXFILE.TXT", type the new name in the To
 box. For more information on HPFS, see Chapter 16, "Using the
 High-Performance File System."

 Printing a File

 You print text files by using a mouse or by
 using the Print command on the File menu. Most MS OS/2 applications have a
 print command you can use to print files that were created with the
 application. You should use that command, rather than printing from File
 Manager, whenever possible. Before you print from File Manager, you should
 set up your printer. When you installed MS OS/2, a default printer,
 PRINTER1, was set up; however, you may need to change printer settings in
 Print Manager for use with your printer. For more information, see Chapter
 4, "Printing Files." To print files by using a mouse, follow these steps:

       Mouse 

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the file you want to
       print.

   2.  Select the file you want to print.

   3.  Using the right mouse button, drag the file onto the Print Manager
       icon. If Print Manager has been enlarged to a window, drag the file
       into the Print Manager window.

       A dialog box appears, listing the print queues and printers set up on
       your system.

   4.  Select the print queue or printer you want to send the file to for
       printing.

   5.  Choose the OK button.


 To print files by using the keyboard, follow these steps:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the file you want to
       print.

   2.  Select the file you want to print.

   3.  Select the File menu and choose the Print command.

       A dialog box appears, listing the print queues and printers set up on
       your system.

   4.  Select the print queue or printer you want to send the file to for
       printing.

   5.  Choose the OK button.




 Searching for a File or Directory

 You can search for a file or directory by using the Search command on the
 File menu. You can base the search on the filename or directory name; for
 files, you can base the search on other file information, such as the file
 size, the date files were changed, or extended-attribute information.
 Extended attributes are created by applications designed to run in MS OS/2
 and can include information such as the subject of the file or key phrases
 in the file. For more information on viewing and creating extended
 attributes, see "Viewing and Setting File Attributes," later in this
 chapter.

 If files or directories are found matching the pattern or information you
 specified, the results are displayed in a special File Manager window. You
 can select items in this window and use File Manager commands just as you
 would in any directory window. To search for a file or a directory, follow
 these steps:

   1.  Select the File menu and choose the Search command.

       The Search dialog box, as shown in the following example, appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   2.  If you are basing the search on name, type the filename or directory
       name you want to find in the Search For box. You can use wildcard
       characters, * and ?, to specify a range of files matching a pattern.

   3.  The Search on Property box contains the different file and directory
       properties on which you can base your search. The default setting is
       Name. To see the list of other properties, click the Down arrow or, if
       you are using the keyboard, move to the Search on Property box and
       press ALT+DOWN.

   4.  If you are basing your search on a property other than name, select
       the property from the Search on Property box. For details on each of
       the file properties available, see the information following this
       procedure list.

   5.  The Search From Directory box specifies the root directory of the
       current drive. This is where a search begins, continuing through all
       the directories on your current drive. You can change this, for
       example, to specify a particular directory or a different drive. To
       change this information, type the path for the directory where you
       want the search to begin.

   6.  Choose the Search button.

   7.  If you are basing your search on a property other than filename or
       directory name, a dialog box appears for the particular property.

       Complete the dialog box and choose the Search button.


 You can base your search for files and directories on the following
 properties:

 Subject                           Descriptive text about the subject of a
                                   file or directory. This information is
                                   stored as an extended attribute. You can
                                   specify the Subject text to be searched
                                   for and whether the search is
                                   case-sensitive.

 Date                              The date the file or directory was last
                                   changed. You can search for files and
                                   directories that changed before, on, or
                                   after a specific date.

 Size                              The size of a file, in bytes, or the
                                   number of files in a directory. You can
                                   search for files and directories that
                                   are larger than or equal to a particular
                                   size or that are smaller than or equal
                                   to the size.

 Flags                             The file flags set for the file or
                                   directory. You can search for files and
                                   directories with the Archive, Read-only,
                                   and Hidden file flags set.

 Type                              The file or directory type. This
                                   information is stored as an extended
                                   attribute. You select a type, such as
                                   Plain Text or Command File, from a list
                                   of types.

 Comments                          Descriptive text stored as an extended
                                   attribute. You can specify the Comment
                                   text to be searched for and whether the
                                   search is case-sensitive.

 Key Phrases                       Descriptive text stored as an extended
                                   attribute. You can specify the Key
                                   Phrases text to be searched for and
                                   whether the search is case-sensitive.

 History                           Descriptive text stored as an extended
                                   attribute. You can specify the History
                                   text to be searched for and whether the
                                   search is case-sensitive.

 Some files and directories may not have extended-attribute information
 associated with them, so searches based on that information will miss those
 files. After a search is completed, the files and directories that are found
 appear in a File Manager window called Search Results. For example, if you
 search your C drive for files matching MEMO*, the Search Results window
 might contain the following files:

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 The Search Results window resembles a directory window except that the full
 path for each file and directory always appears. You cannot use the Name or
 Icon commands on the View menu to change the way this information is
 displayed. However, you can select files or directories in the window and
 use File menu commands to perform tasks such as printing or copying and
 moving. The Search Results window is also listed in the Window menu, along
 with the other open windows.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 You can also reduce the Search Results window to an icon.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 The Search Results window remains open until you close it or reduce it to an
 icon. The contents of the Search Results window are replaced when you use
 the Search command again.


 Starting an Application


 You can start an MS OS/2 application from File Manager by opening the program
 file. Program files end with the characters or .BAT. If the application can
 run in a window, the window appears in front of File Manager when you start
 it. If the application is a full-screen application, the application screen
 replaces the Presentation Manager screen.
 If the application is a DOS application, you can start it from File Manager;
 however, you can run only one DOS application at a time. If you already have
 an application running in the DOS session, a message appears, asking you to
 quit the program.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you plan to use an application frequently, you should add it to a Desktop
 Manager group window rather than starting it from File Manager. For more
 information on adding applications to group windows, see Chapter 2, "Running
 Applications with MS OS/2."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 To start an application by using a mouse, do the following:

       Mouse 

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the application file.

   2.  Double-click the application filename.


 To start an application by using the keyboard, do the following:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the application file.

   2.  Select the application filename.

   3.  Select the File menu and choose the Open command.


 Or

   ş   Select the filename in the directory window and press ENTER.


 You can also start an application from a data file by using a mouse or the
 Run command on the File menu. When you start an application this way, the
 application opens the data file. For example, you might start a text-editing
 application by using the file you want to edit. To start an application from
 a data file by using a mouse, follow these steps:

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the data file (the window
       containing the application file must be visible as well).

   2.  Select the data file and, using the right mouse button, drag the
       data-file icon onto the application file.


 You can extend the selection in the directory window to select more than one
 file. If you select more than one file and drag them onto a program file,
 File Manager starts a separate program for each data file. To start one
 application and open several selected files by using a mouse, do the
 following:

   1.  In the directory window, select each file you want to open.

   2.  Press and hold down ALT and, using the right mouse button, drag the
       multiple-file icon onto the application file.


 Some applications do not allow multiple files to be opened at once. In this
 case, only the first file is opened and the others are ignored. To start an
 application from a data file by using the keyboard, follow these steps:

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the data file.

   2.  Select the data file you want to run with the application.

   3.  Select the File menu and choose the Run command.

       The Run dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   4.  Type the program filename in the Program box. If the program is not in
       the current directory, type the path and filename of the program file.

   5.  If you selected more than one file in the directory window, select one
       of the following options: Run a Separate Program for Each File or Run
       a Single Program for All Files.

   6.  Choose the Run button.


 You can use the Minimize On Run command on the Options menu to automatically
 reduce File Manager to an icon whenever you start an application.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 To use the Minimize On Run command, do the following:

   ş   Select the Options menu and choose the Minimize On Run command.




 Associating Application Files

 The Associate command on the File menu allows you to associate an
 application file with other files. For example, you can associate data files
 with the application you used to create them. Once you create the
 association, you can start the application by opening the data file in File
 Manager. Often, data files created with an application have a particular
 filename format; for example, files created with a text-editing application
 might end with the characters .TXT.

 You also can create associations based on combinations of filenames and
 wildcard characters, or based on file type; for example, you could associate
 an application with all files that have the Plain Text file type.

 You can associate files in two ways:

   ş   By selecting a specific program file and providing the file type or
       filename information

   ş   By selecting a specific data-file name and providing program-file
       information


 Follow these steps to use the Associate command:

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the file you want to
       associate. The file can be either a program file or a data file.

   2.  Select the file you want to associate.

   3.  Select the File menu and choose the Associate command.

       The Add Association dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   4.  Type the requested information in the dialog box.

       For details on completing the Add Association dialog box, see the
       information following this procedure list.

   5.  Choose the Add button.

       The Associate dialog box appears, displaying the file association you
       created.

   6.  Choose the OK button.



 The following list describes each section of the Add Association dialog box:

   ş   In the Program section, the Filename box contains the name of the
       program file you selected in the File Manager window. If you selected
       a data file, this box is empty. You can type the name of the program
       file you want to associate in the Filename box. You can also specify
       the path of the program file. If you do not include the path, File
       Manager searches for the program file in the path specified in your
       CONFIG.SYS file.

   ş   In the Parameters box, you type any command argumentsÄfor example, an
       option or filename. Type these arguments just as you would if you were
       typing the command at the MS OS/2 command prompt. This information is
       optional.

       To display a dialog box asking for command arguments each time you
       start the program, you can type the message text, enclosed in square
       brackets ([ ]) in the Parameters box. By default, the data-file name
       is the last command argument on a command line. If you want the
       data-file name to be placed at another location in relation to the
       command arguments you specified in the Parameters section, type %* at
       the correct location.

   ş   The File Type box lists the file types that can be associated. If you
       selected a data file, the data-file type is listedÄfor example, Plain
       Text or Data. If you selected a program file, all available file types
       are listed. You can select a type of file from the File Type box to
       associate with the program file.

   ş   The Name Filter box specifies which filenames are associated with the
       program file. If you selected a data file in the File Manager window,
       this box contains an asterisk and the filename extensionÄfor example,
       *.TXT. If you selected a program file, you can type the filename
       filter, a combination of wildcard and filename characters that match
       the filenames you want to be associated with the program file.

       You can associate a filename filter with more than one application.
       Then, when you open a file with an associated filename filter, a
       dialog box appears, asking you to select the application you want to
       start.


 You can change command-argument information associated with a file. Follow
 these steps:

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the application file or
       filename extension you want to change.

   2.  Select the file for which you want to change the associated file
       information.

   3.  Select the File menu and choose the Associate command.

       The Associate dialog box appears.

   4.  Choose the Change button.

       The Change Association dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   5.  To change or add command-argument information, edit the contents of
       the Parameters box.

   6.  Choose the Change button.

       The Associate dialog box is displayed again.

   7.  Choose the OK button.


 You can remove a file or a filename extension from the list of associated
 files. Follow these steps:

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the application file or
       filename extension you want to delete.

   2.  Select the file you want to delete from the list of associated files.

   3.  Select the File menu and choose the Associate command.

       If you choose an application file, a list of files associated with it
       is displayed. If you choose a file with an associated extension, a
       list of associated program files is displayed.

   4.  To delete an association, select the itemÄeither the program file or
       the filename extensionÄyou want to delete.

   5.  Choose the Delete button.

   6.  If you are deleting a program file from the list of associations with
       a filename extension, a dialog box appears, confirming that you want
       to delete the association. Choose the Yes button.




 Changing File Flags



 File flags are part of the directory information for a file. This infor-
 mation is used to identify a file to MS OS/2 and controls the kinds of
 operations you perform on the file. You can see the file flags in a
 directory window by using the File Details command on the View menu. This
 displays all file information, including the file flags.
 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 File flags can be turned on and off by using the Change Flags command on the
 File menu. There are four MS OS/2 file flags:

   ş   The Read-only flag prevents a file from being changed. When it is
       turned on, the letter "R" appears in the flag-information column in
       the directory listing.

   ş   The Archive flag is turned on by MS OS/2 utilities such as backup and
       xcopy. When it is turned on, the letter "A" appears in the
       flag-information column in the directory listing. Other applications
       such as text-editing programs then turn off this flag to indicate to
       MS OS/2 that the file has been changed.

   ş   The Hidden flag prevents a file from appearing in most directory
       listings. When this flag is turned on, the letter "H" appears in the
       directory listing.

   ş   The System flag identifies a file as an MS OS/2 system file. When this
       flag is turned on, the letter "S" appears in the directory listing.
       You cannot delete a file when this flag is set. This flag, like the
       Hidden flag, prevents a file from appearing in directory listings.


 To turn file flags on or off, do the following:

   1.  Open a window on the directory that contains the file for which you
       want to set flags.

   2.  Select the file.

   3.  Select the File menu and choose the Change Flags command.

       The Change Flags dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   4.  Turn on or off the file flags you want.

   5.  Choose the Change button.


 You can change file flags for more than one file at a time by extending your
 selection in the directory window.


 Viewing and Setting File Attributes

 In MS OS/2, applications can create additional pieces of informa- tion about
 files in the form of extended attributes. This information is stored
 separately from the file itself and is used to identify the file to MS OS/2,
 File Manager, and to other applications. For example, extended attributes
 could contain the following kinds of information:

   ş   The file type, such as program file, data file, or command file

   ş   The icon that appears in File Manager

   ş   Other information specific to the application


 Extended attributes are created and supported by applications designed to
 run in MS OS/2. The information contained in extended attributes may vary
 from application to application. There are some standard kinds of extended
 attributes. The Properties command on the File menu is used to view and
 modify some of the extended attributes, as well as to view other file
 information such as file flags and size. You also can use the Properties
 command to create some kinds of extended attributes for files that do not
 already have them.

 You can base file searches on the extended-attribute information by using
 the Search command on the File menu. See "Searching for a File or
 Directory," earlier in this chapter, for more information. To view the
 extended attributes, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the file in the directory window.

   2.  Select the File menu and choose the Properties command.

       When the Properties dialog box is first displayed, the bottom half of
       the dialog box does not appear. To expand the dialog box, choose the
       More button.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).
 For details about each of the areas in the Properties dialog box, see the
 information following this procedure list.

   3.  To add a file type to the list of types, choose the Type button.

       A dialog box appears, showing the available file types.

   4.  Select the file type you want to add and choose the Add button.

       A dialog box appears, showing the types for the file.

   5.  You can choose to add or delete more file types by using the Add and
       Delete buttons.

   6.  When you finish adding or deleting file types, choose the OK button.

       The Properties dialog box appears again.

   7.  If you have an icon editor (an application that creates icons), you
       can customize the icon that is used by the file. Choose the Icon
       button to specify a new icon file.

       A dialog box appears.

   8.  Type the path and filename of the new icon file.

   9.  Choose the OK button.

      The Properties dialog box appears again.

   10. If you want the Properties dialog box to be expanded each time you use
       the Properties command, turn on the Unfold check box.

   11. When you finish viewing or changing the information in the Properties
       dialog box, choose the OK button.


 The following list explains each section of the Properties dialog box:

                                   it exists, can only be viewed, not
                                   edited.



 Turning Off a Confirmation Message

 The Confirmation command on the Options menu is used to turn confirmation
 messages on and off. These messages usually appear in File Manager and ask
 you to confirm that you want to carry out a particular action, such as
 deleting a file.

 The settings you make with the Confirmation command can be saved when you
 quit File Manager if you turn on the Save Settings check box. Dialog boxes
 in File Manager often have check boxes that let you turn on or off the
 message for an individual command; the settings you make with the
 Confirmation command become the default settings. The following list
 explains each message you can set using the Confirmation command:

 Message                           Confirms

 Introduction


 This chapter explains how to set up printers and print files on your system.
 Printer Installer, a Presentation Manager application, lets you quickly set
 up a printer with your computer. For more complicated printer setups (for
 example, if you want print jobs to be shared between several printers), you
 can use Print Manager. However, Printer Installer is the recommended
 application to use for installing printers. Both methods for setting up
 printers are described in this chapter.
 After you have set up your printer, you can also use Print Manager to
 control the way files print after you send them to the printer. Print
 Manager is the Presentation Manager application that organizes and controls
 printing for MS OS/2. Print Manager starts each time you start your system;
 it appears as an icon at the bottom of your screen.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 All examples of filenames and directory names in this chapter use the file
 allocation table (FAT) file system, which is the file system used by DOS and
 MS OS/2 versions 1.1 and earlier. For information on using high-performance
 file system (HPFS) filenames and directory names, see Chapter 16, "Using the
 High-Performance File System."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Setting Up a Printer by Using Printer Installer


 Printer Installer, a Presentation Manager application, lets you quickly set
 up a printer on your system. Before you set up a printer by using Printer
 Installer, you need to know the following information about your printer:
   ş   The name and model of your printer.

   ş   That the necessary physical connections have been made to use your
       printer. See your printer manual for more information on installing
       your printer.

   ş   Which port your printer is connected to.




 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you are adding a serial printer that is connected to a communications
 port (COM1, COM2, or COM3), you must first use the Communications Port
 command in Control Panel to create communications-port settings. The COM
 ports are not listed as ports in the Printer Installer dialog box until you
 create a setting for them by using Control Panel. For information on using
 the Communications Port command, see Chapter 5, "Changing System Settings
 with Control Panel."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 To set up a printer by using Printer Installer, follow these steps:

   1.  Switch to Desktop Manager and choose the Utilities Group.

   2.  Choose Printer Installer.

       A message appears while any installed printer drivers are being
       located on your disk drive. After the search is completed, the Printer
       Installer dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.  The Model list box contains the names and models of printers currently
       available for installation on your computer. If your printer model
       appears in the list box, select your printer.

   4.  If your printer does not appear in the list box, choose the New
       command button.

       A dialog box appears, asking you to insert in drive A the disk that
       contains the printer-driver files. Insert your printer-driver disk in
       drive A or type the path of the directory containing the
       printer-driver files and choose the OK button. A dialog box appears,
       listing the printer models and their corresponding printer-driver
       files. Select the appropriate printer model and choose OK to return to
       the Printer Installer dialog box.

   5.  In the Connect To list box, select the port your printer is connected
       to.

   6.  The Default check box is turned on, indicating that the printer will
       be the default printer for your computer. If you want to change the
       setting, turn off the check box.

   7.  Choose the OK button.

   8.  Depending upon which printer you selected, an additional dialog box
       may appear, asking you to confirm or change the settings for your
       printer. Change any settings, if necessary, and choose the OK button.


 If, after you set up a printer, you need to change the printer settings or
 delete the printer, use Print Manager. If you make a mistake when you set up
 your printer by using Printer Installer (for example, if you select the
 wrong printer model or port), you can delete the printer by using Print
 Manager and then re-install it by using Printer Installer.

 Printer Installer makes all the necessary print and print queue settings. If
 you use Print Manager to re-install your printer, you will need to create
 these settings by using several commands from Print Manager and Control
 Panel. For more information, see "Setting Up a Printer by Using Print
 Manager" later in this chapter.


 Printing a File

 If you have a printer connected to your computer, you can print text files
 from Presentation Manager, from the MS OS/2 command interpreter (cmd), from
 the DOS session, or by using your application's print command. To print a
 text file from Presentation Manager by using a mouse, follow these steps:

       Mouse 

   1.  Switch to the Main-group window and start File Manager.

   2.  In File Manager, click the directory that contains the file you want
       to print.

   3.  In the directory window, select the file you want to print.

   4.  Using the right mouse button, drag the file icon into the Print
       Manager window or onto the Print Manager icon.

       A dialog box appears, showing the printers and print queues set up on
       your system.

   5.  Select the print queue or printer you want.

   6.  Choose the OK button.


 To print a text file from Presentation Manager by using the keyboard, follow
 these steps:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Switch to the Main-group window and start File Manager.

   2.  In File Manager, open a directory window that contains the file you
       want to print.

   3.  In the directory window, select the file you want to print.

   4.  Select the File menu and choose the Print command.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).
 A dialog box appears, showing the printers and print queues set up on your
 system.

   5.  Select the print queue or printer you want.

   6.  Choose the OK button.


 You use the print utility to print files from the MS OS/2 command
 interpreter, cmd, or from the DOS session by doing the following:

   1.  Switch to the Main-group window and start OS/2 Window. To print from
       the DOS session, use the Task List to switch to the DOS session.

   2.  At the prompt, type print, the path (if necessary), and the filename
       of the file you want to print. For example, to print the file
       PROPOSAL.TXT in the PROJECT directory on drive C, type the following:

 print c:\eproject\eproposal.txt




   3.  Press ENTER.

       The file is sent to the default print queue on your system.


 For more information on the print utility, see Chapter 9, "Using MS OS/2
 Utilities," and the print entry in the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command
 Reference.

 To print from your application, see your application manual for information
 on its print command.


 Setting Up a Printer by Using Print Manager

 You can use Print Manager to change how
 printers are set up, to add and remove printers, and to change print-queue
 settings. With Print Manager, you can set up several printers and print
 queues on your system. Then, when you are printing multiple files, you can
 use Print Manager to prioritize and distribute print jobs so that they are
 processed as quickly as possible. Print Manager commands also let you
 control the kinds of jobs printed on a particular printer.

 Setting up a printer by using Print Manager involves several steps. You
 should be familiar with all the steps before you use this method to set up a
 printer. Printer Installer provides a more streamlined approach to setting
 up a printer and is recommended for most users, particularly if you do not
 plan to have multiple printers set up for a print queue. You can also use
 Printer Installer to initially set up a printer and print queue and then use
 Print Manager to install additional printers that will use the queue.

 Before you use the printer commands in Print Manager, you should be familiar
 with the following terms:

   ş   The printer name is a name you assign to your printer. When you set up
       MS OS/2, the printer name PRINTER1 (the default setting) was created,
       even if you do not have an actual printer on your system. You can use
       Print Manager to change the settings for PRINTER1 or to create new
       printers.

   ş   The default printer is the printer your files are printed on unless
       your application specifies a different printer. The default printer is
       PRINTER1 when you first set up MS OS/2 on your system. You can change
       the default printer by using Print Manager.

   ş   The port is a slot in your computer where you connect your printer.
       There are three printer ports (LPT1, LPT2, and LPT3) and three
       communications ports (COM1, COM2, and COM3). You connect parallel
       printers to printer ports and serial printers to communications ports.
       You connect a printer to a particular port by plugging it in or, if
       you are sharing a printer over a network, by assigning it to a port by
       using a network command. In order to use communications ports with
       your system, you need to set up the communications-port device drivers
       on your system. You can set up these device drivers by selecting the
       Add Serial Device Support option while running the MS OS/2
       installation program or by editing your CONFIG.SYS file to add this
       support after installation. For more information on adding a
       communications-port line to your CONFIG.SYS file, see Chapter 17,
       "Using MS OS/2 Device Drivers."

   ş   A printer driver, sometimes called a "device driver," is a program
       that controls printing and lets you set options such as paper size,
       the printer model, and the amount of printer memory for your printer.
       Some printer drivers are included with your MS OS/2 installation
       disks. You use Control Panel to install printer drivers on your
       system. Using Print Manager, you associate printer drivers with a
       particular printer by specifying the name of the printer. You can also
       use Print Manager to change printer-driver settings for a printer.

   ş   A print queue is a list of files or print jobs waiting to be printed.
       Print Manager maintains print queues. Printers must be connected to a
       print queue for printing to take place. When you print files from
       Presentation Manager, the files are first sent to the print queue and
       then sent to the printer that uses the queue. You make this connection
       by using Print Manager. More than one printer can be connected to a
       queue; Print Manager prioritizes and organizes printing so that print
       jobs in a queue are sent to the first available printer. A printer can
       be shared by more than one queue. By default setting, each queue uses
       one printer driver. (An application can also specify a different
       printer driver.) You can change print-queue settings or create a new
       queue by using Print Manager commands.


 Setting up a printer and a print queue involves several steps. The following
 is an overview of the process and the commands you use to set up a printer:

   ş   Install the appropriate printer driver by using the Add Printer Driver
       command in Control Panel. Check your printer manual for the correct
       printer driver to use. For more information, see the next section,
       "Adding and Deleting a Printer Driver."

   ş   Add the printer and set the printer options by using the Printers
       command in Print Manager. For more information, see "Adding a Printer"
       later in this chapter.

   ş   Add the print queue and set the options for the print jobs by using
       the Queues command in Print Manager. For more information, see
       "Setting Up a Print Queue" later in this chapter.

 Note

 Some applications, such as full-screen OS/2 applications, are not designed
 to use the print-spooling capabilities of Print Manager. These applications
 may print directly to printer ports rather than to print queues. See your
 application manual for information on setting up printing from these
 applications.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Adding and Deleting a Printer Driver

 Printer drivers, sometimes called device drivers, are programs that control
 how your printer prints. Some printer drivers are included with your MS OS/2
 installation disks; others may be supplied by the printer manufacturer.
 Printer-driver files have a .DRV filename extension; the files often support
 more than one printer model. Check your printer manual for information on
 which printer driver to use with your printer.

 Printer Installer also lets you set up new printer drivers on your system as
 part of the printer installation process. For more information, see "Setting
 Up a Printer by Using Printer Installer" earlier in this chapter.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 One printer-driver file, IBMNULL.DRV, sends the printer only data and
 printer control characters created by an application. If there is no printer
 driver available for your printer, you can use this printer driver to print
 from an application. Check the application manual to see whether the
 application uses this printer driver to support your printer. Your
 application must provide all printer support if you are using the IBMNULL
 driver; MS OS/2 print functions are not supported for this printer driver.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 In addition, you should create a separate print queue for printing from your
 application. This print queue should not be the default print queue for your
 computer. For information on setting up print queues, see "Adding a Print
 Queue" later in this chapter.
 You can use the Add Printer Driver command in Control Panel to install
 printer drivers for use by Print Manager. To add a printer driver, follow
 these steps:

   1.  Switch to Desktop Manager and choose the Utilities group.

   2.  Choose Control Panel.

   3.  Select the Installation menu and choose the Add Printer Driver
       command.

       The Add Printer Driver dialog box appears, asking you to insert in
       drive A the disk that contains the printer-driver files.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   4.  Insert your printer-driver disk or type the path for the
       printer-driver files. If printer-driver files are already copied to
       your hard disk, they are located in the \eOS2\eDLL directory.

   5.  Choose the Add button.

       The Add Printer Driver dialog box appears, displaying the
       printer-driver files.

   6.  Select the printer driver you want in the Printer Drivers box. You can
       select more than one printer driver. Click each printer driver you
       want; if you are using the keyboard, press the DIRECTION keys to move
       to each printer driver and press the SPACEBAR to select it.

   7.  Choose the Add button.


 To delete a printer driver by using the Delete Printer Driver command in
 Control Panel, follow these steps:

   1.  In Control Panel, select the Installation menu and choose the Delete
       Printer Driver command.

       The Delete Printer Driver dialog box appears, displaying the printer
       drivers installed on your system.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   2.  In the Printer Drivers box, select the printer driver you want to
       delete.

   3.  Choose the Delete button.

       A dialog box appears, asking you to confirm deleting the printer
       driver.

   4.  To delete the printer driver, choose the Yes button.

       The Delete Printer Driver dialog box appears, displaying the path
       where the printer-driver file is located.

 Adding a Printer

 You can add a printer to your system by using
 Print Manager. Before you start this procedure, you should know the
 following information about your printer:

   ş   That the necessary physical connections have been made to use your
       printer. See your printer manual for more information on installing
       your printer.

   ş   Which port your printer is connected to.

   ş   Which printer driver you want to use and that it has been installed by
       using Control Panel.


 You can also add a printer to your system by using Printer Installer. For
 more information, see "Setting Up a Printer by Using Printer Installer"
 earlier in this chapter.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you are adding a serial printer that is connected to a communications
 port (COM1, COM2, or COM3), you must first use the Communications Port
 command in Control Panel to create communications-port settings. The COM
 ports are not listed as ports in Printer Manager until you create a setting
 for them by using Control Panel. For information on using the Communications
 Port command, see Chapter 5, "Changing System Settings with Control Panel."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 If you want to print to a serial printer from a full-screen OS/2
 application, you may need to use the spool command to redirect printer
 output from a printer port (for example, LPT1) to a communications port. For
 more information on using this command, see the spool entry in the Microsoft
 Operating System/2 Command Reference.
 To add a printer, follow these steps:

   1.  In Print Manager, select the Setup menu and choose the Printers
       command.

       The Printers dialog box appears, displaying the printers that are set
       up on your system.

       The Add Printer dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.  In the Name box, type the new printer name.

   4.  In the Description box, type a description of the printer (for
       example, the type of printer and its location).

   5.  In the Device section, select the port the printer is connected to. To
       see a list of available ports by using a mouse, click the Down arrow;
       to see the list by using the keyboard, press ALT+DOWN.

   6.  In the Printer Drivers section, select the printer driver to be used
       with the printer. You can select more than one printer driver; the
       last printer driver selected is listed as the default driver in the
       dialog box. Check your printer manual for the appropriate driver. (If
       you need to add a new printer-driver file, see "Adding and Deleting a
       Printer Driver" earlier in this chapter.)

   7.  To create printer settings, choose the Printer Properties button.

       A dialog box appears, displaying the options specific to the printer
       driver you selected. The options may include the printer model, number
       of paper bins, the types of forms (for example, Legal), or how much
       memory the printer has. You may also be able to create new settings if
       you are using nonstandard paper sizes in your printing. The Printer
       Properties dialog box may also allow you to set the properties of a
       particular print job (for example, to specify landscape instead of
       portrait paper orientation). Set the options you want and choose the
       OK button to return to the Add Printer dialog box.

   8.  Choose the Add button.

       The Printers dialog box appears again.

   9.  Choose the OK button.


 After you set up a printer, you must create a print queue for it or specify
 an existing print queue. For more information, see "Adding a Print Queue"
 later in this chapter.

       the printer. To add a new printer-driver file, see "Adding and
       Deleting a Printer Driver" earlier in this chapter.


 If you are connecting a serial printer to one of the communications ports
 (COM1, COM2, or COM3), you must set the options for the port, such as baud
 rate and parity (see your printer manual for information on the correct
 settings to use). You can do this using the Communications Port command in
 Control Panel. For information on changing communications-port settings, see
 Chapter 5, "Changing System Settings with Control Panel."


 Setting Up a Print Queue

 You can set up new print queues and make adjustments to existing queues by
 using the commands on the Setup menu in Print Manager. Printers you set up
 must be connected to a print queue. If you set up a printer by using Printer
 Installer, the print queue is created automatically and named according to
 your printer model. For more information, see "Adding a Printer by Using
 Printer Installer" earlier in this chapter.


 Adding a Print Queue

 To add a print queue, you use the Queues command on the Setup menu in Print
 Manager.

 Before you set up a print queue, you should become familiar with the
 following information:

   ş   Which printers the queue will use. You should set up the printers to
       be used with the queue before you set up the queue.

   ş   Which printer driver will be used with the print queue. A print queue
       can be shared by more than one printer, but the printers and the print
       queue must have a printer driver in common.

       You may want to organize print queues by the kind of print jobs you
       will be printing. For example, draft-quality documents that are
       printed by using landscape mode are sent to one queue, and
       letter-quality documents that are printed in portrait mode are sent to
       another. Both queues can send print jobs to the same printers, but the
       print-job settings determine the kind of printing to be done.

   ş   Which queue driver will be used with a particular queue. A queue
       driver is the program that prepares a file for printing. Queue drivers
       are installed on your system when you install MS OS/2. You use one
       queue driver for printers and another for other printing devices, such
       as plotters. To add a print queue, follow these steps:
       1.  In Print Manager, select the Setup menu and choose the Queues
           command.

           The Queues dialog box appears, displaying the existing queue names
           and descriptions.

           (This figure may be found in the printed book).

       2.  Choose the Add button.

           The Add Queue dialog box appears.

           (This figure may be found in the printed book).

       3.  To add a new queue, type the new queue name in the Name box.

       4.  Move to the Description box and type a description of the queue;
           for example, you may want to describe the type of print jobs that
           will be printed on the queue, such as "Draft-Quality Printing."

       5.  Move to the Queue Driver box. If you are using a mouse to view a
           list of the queue drivers set up on your system, click the Down
           arrow; to view the list by using the keyboard, press ALT+DOWN.
           Select the queue driver you want.

       6.  Move to the Separator box. Type the name of the separator-page

 Changing the Default Print Queue and Printer


 When you install MS OS/2, a default print queue, LPT1Q, is set up on your
 system. It is the default print queue for your Presentation Manager
 applications. Some applications, such as File Manager, display a dialog box
 when you use the Print command that allows you to choose the print queue or
 printer you want to send the file to. Many applications send print jobs to
 the default print queue, however, which you specify by using the Application
 Defaults command on the Setup menu in Print Manager. If you set up more than
 one print queue or printer, you may want to change the default settings for
 your system. Some applications, such as Presentation Manager applications
 designed for MS OS/2 version 1.1, may send files to the default printer. If
 you have more than one printer, you can change a default printer by using
 the Application Defaults command.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 The Application Defaults command establishes the default print queue and
 printer for Presentation Manager applications only. Applications that do not
 use Print Manager, such as full-screen OS/2 applications, are not affected
 by these settings.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Controlling a Print Job by Using Print Manager

 Print Manager helps you control printing. Before you use Print
 Manager, you should be familiar with the following terms:

   ş   A print queue is a list of files waiting to be printed. From the print
       queue, files are sent to the first available printer. A print queue
       can send files to more than one printer.

   ş   A print job is a file that has been sent for printing.

   ş   Spooling is the process of sending print jobs to printers and managing
       print queues. Spooling is one of the tasks that Print Manager
       performs.

   ş   A job identifier is a number that identifies a particular print job.


 With Print Manager, you can see status information on an entire print queue
 or on an individual print job. To check on the status of a print job, do the
 following:

   ş   Switch to Print Manager.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).


 In the Print Manager work area, you see each print queue listed with the
 number of print jobs (files) in the queue. Each print job is identified by
 its job identifier, document name, and the date and time it was sent to the
 print queue. For some print jobs, the name of the application you are
 printing from also appears.

 Before you can use the commands on the Queue or Job menus, you must select a
 print job or queue. You can select more than one item at a time. To select a
 print queue or print job by using the mouse, do the following:

       Mouse 

   ş   Click the item or items you want to select.


 To select a print queue or print job by using the keyboard, do the
 following:

       Keyboard 

   1.  Press the DIRECTION keys to move the cursor to each item.

   2.  Press the SPACEBAR to select the item.


 To cancel your selection by using the mouse, click the item again. If you
 are using the keyboard, press the SPACEBAR again to cancel a selection.

 If you select a print job, you can use the commands on the Queue and Job
 menus; if you select a print queue, you can only use the commands on the
 Queue menu.


 Controlling Print Queues

 You can stop, restart, or cancel printing by controlling the print queue;
 for example, you may need to stop printing to change paper or fix a problem
 with your printer. You use the commands on the Queue menu to control print
 queues. You can stop all printing from a queue by using the Hold Queue
 command on the Queue menu. If a file is printing when you choose this
 command, it finishes printing. To use the Hold Queue command, follow these
 steps:

   1.  Select the print queue in the Print Manager work area.

   2.  Select the Queue menu and choose the Hold Queue command.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).


 To resume printing, do the following:

   1.  Select the print queue in the Print Manager work area.

   2.  Select the Queue menu and choose the Release Queue command.




 Controlling Print Jobs

 You can control print jobsÄfiles that you are printing on a printerÄby using
 Print Manager commands.

 Looking at Print-Job Information

 You can find out information on a particular print job by using the Job
 Details command on the Job menu. You can also use this command to change the
 number of copies you are printing. To see print-job information, do the
 following:

   1.  In the Print Manager work area, select the print jobs you want.

   2.  Select the Job menu and choose the Job Details command.

 Moving a Print Job in the Print Queue

 You can prioritize a particular print job so that it prints ahead of other
 jobs in the queue by using the Print Job Next command on the Job menu. The
 file prints when a printer becomes available. If you prioritize a print job
 that has been held, it becomes the first job in the queue but it is still
 held until you release it. For more information on holding and releasing a
 print job, see "Holding a Print Job" later in this chapter. .RT To move a
 print job to the top of the queue, follow these steps:

   1.  In the Print Manager work area, select the print job.

   2.  Select the Job menu and choose the Print Job Next command.

       The priority of the print job is set to 99Äthe highest priority.


 You also can change the priority of a print job by using the Job Details
 command on the Job menu. The priority of a print job is represented by a
 number from 1 through 99; the default is 50 (the higher the number, the
 sooner the job is printed). To change the priority of a print
 ob, do the following:

   1.  In the Print Manager work area, select the print job.

   2.  Select the Job menu and choose the Job Details command.

 Introduction

 MS OS/2 Command Reference is a Presentation Manager application that you can
 use to view the contents of the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command
 Reference on your computer. When you start MS OS/2 Command Reference, the
 table of contents for the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference
 appears in a window. From the table of contents, you can view information
 about specific topics and commands, and you can search and print topic
 information and use the Bookmark feature to keep track of topics you view
 most often.

 MS OS/2 Command Reference is similar to Help. The menus and commands are
 almost identical, and the way you use them is exactly the same. The tasks
 presented in this chapter can also be accomplished by using the commands in
 Help. The difference is that, with MS OS/2 Command Reference, you are
 viewing and working with the information in the Microsoft Operating System/2
 Command Reference. With Help, you are viewing and working with Help
 information for the application you are using.

 This chapter explains how to perform the following tasks by using MS OS/2
 Command Reference:

   ş   Viewing topic information

   ş   Using the table of contents window

   ş   Searching, printing, and copying topic information

   ş   Using the Bookmark feature to mark topics

 Often the information for a topic does not fit in one window. As with other
 Presentation Manager applications, you can use scroll bars to scroll topic
 information. If you are using the keyboard, you can use the PAGE UP and PAGE
 DOWN keys to scroll topic information. For information on scrolling in a
 window, see Chapter 1, "Learning Basic Presentation Manager Skills."


 Viewing a Related Topic

 Some topics include related terms, concepts, or topics that you can view
 directly from the topic window. These terms, concepts, and topics appear in
 a different color in the text. To display information for a related term,
 concept, or topic, do the following:

 Mouse                             Keyboard
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 or topic you want.                or topic you want.

                                   2  Press ENTER.

 If the information for the related topic is short, it appears in a small
 window inside the current topic window. If there is a lot of information on
 the topic, it appears in a separate topic window.


 Returning to the Contents Window

 You can return to the Contents window from a topic window at any time by
 using the Contents command on the Options menu. To return to the Contents
 window, do the following:

   ş   Select the Options menu and choose the Contents command.


 The Contents window appears inside the topic window. When the Contents
 window is displayed, you can choose another topic to view.

 The topic information immediately preceding the current topic information
 appears. Repeatedly choosing the Previous command displays each previous
 topic. If there is no previous topic available, then choosing the Previous
 command returns you to the Contents window.

 Another way to review a topic is by using the Viewed Pages command. The
 Viewed Pages command displays a list of all previously viewed topics so that
 you can quickly look at the topic you want without choosing the Previous
 command. To display a list of viewed topics, do the following:

   ş   Select the Options menu and choose the Viewed Pages command.

       The Viewed Pages window appears inside the current window.

 Chapter 8  Running Cmd
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Introduction

 The MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd, is a program that translates what you
 type at a prompt into commands that your computer can use. When you install
 MS OS/2, the cmd prompt looks like the following:

 [C:\e]


 You can run cmd in a full-screen session or in a window. Instead of the
 Presentation Manager graphical environment, cmd provides a command-line
 interface. This means that cmd displays a prompt where you type commands to
 start other programs.

 Cmd contains a set of built-in commands that help you to manage files and
 directories, create and run batch programs, and set system features. You can
 start other programs by using cmd, so it provides an alternative to Desktop
 Manager if you are working in a full-screen session or if you are running
 cmd in a window.

 This chapter describes how to start and quit the cmd program, and how to use
 cmd commands. It also describes the keys command, which can be used to edit
 the cmd command line. For more information about utilities that can be run
 from the cmd program, see Chapter 9, "Using MS OS/2 Utilities."

 This chapter also contains information about how the cmd program and cmd
 commands work in the file allocation table (FAT) file system. Some commands
 may work differently when you use them in the high-performance file system
 (HPFS). All examples of file and directory names in this chapter are for the
 FAT file system. For more information about using commands in HPFS, see
 Chapter 16, "Using the High-Performance File System."


 Starting and Quitting Cmd

 You can start the MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd, either in a full-screen
 session or in a window in the Presentation Manager session. From the Main
 group in Desktop Manager, do one of the following:

   ş   To start cmd in a full-screen session, choose OS/2 Full Screen from
       the Main group in Desktop Manager.


 Or

   ş   To start cmd in a window, choose OS/2 Window from the Main group in
       Desktop Manager.


 If you start cmd in a full-screen session, the screen clears and the cmd
 prompt appears in the full screen. If you start cmd in a window, a new
 window appears in the Presentation Manager session and the cmd prompt
 appears in the window.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 You can also start cmd in a window from File Manager by double-clicking the
 CMD.EXE file. For more information about File Manager, see Chapter 3, "Using
 File Manager."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 To quit cmd, type exit at the prompt. If cmd is running in a full-screen
 session, Desktop Manager appears. If cmd is running in a window, the window
 closes and then Desktop Manager appears.

 If you want to switch from a full-screen session to the Task List without
 quitting cmd, press CTRL+ESC. The full-screen session will then appear as an
 entry in the Task List.


 Using Commands

 To use a command in cmd, you type the command on the command line and press
 ENTER. This section explains how to use the command line to start commands,
 and also how you can use the features of the keys command to edit the
 command line.


 Starting Commands

 After you have started cmd, you are ready to use commands. At the cmd
 command prompt, do the following:

   ş   Type the name of the command, followed by any arguments, and press
       ENTER.


 In addition to commands built into cmd, you can also start MS OS/2 utilities
 and other full-screen programs. To start other MS OS/2 programs, see the
 manual that accompanies your program and "Running Programs," later in this
 chapter.


 Editing the Command Line

 When you are running cmd you can perform editing functions on the command
 line by using the keys command. These editing functions will save you time
 when entering commands, by allowing you to call up commands you have already
 typed and use them again without retyping them. You start these functions by
 typing the following on the command line:

 keys on

 Once you have typed the keys command, every command you enter on the command
 line is temporarily saved in a list in memory. To see the list of the
 commands that are currently in memory, type the following on the command
 line:

 keys list

 You can use any of the following keys and key combinations to perform the
 special editing functions that the keys command provides:

 Key                               Editing function
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 ESC                               Clears the current command line and
                                   returns the cursor to the position
                                   immediately following the command prompt.

                                   immediately following the command prompt.

 END                               Places the cursor in the position
                                   immediately following the last character
                                   you typed (even if the last character
                                   you typed is a space).

 INS                               Turns the insert mode on and off. The
                                   cursor appears as a half box when you
                                   are in insert mode. As you insert
                                   characters, existing characters move to
                                   the right. At the beginning of each new
                                   command line, insert mode is turned off.

 DEL                               Deletes the character marked by the
                                   cursor. As you delete characters, any
                                   existing characters to the right of the
                                   cursor move to the left.

 LEFT                              Moves the cursor left one character.

 RIGHT                             Moves the cursor right one character.

 UP                                Finds the previous command listed in
                                   memory and displays that command on the
                                   command line. When you reach the first
                                   command in the list, pressing UP
                                   displays the last command.

 DOWN                              Finds the next command listed in memory
                                   and displays that command on the command
                                   line. When you reach the last command in
                                   the list, pressing DOWN displays the
                                   first command.

 BACKSPACE                         Moves the cursor back (left) one
                                   character and deletes that character.
                                   Any characters to the right of the
                                   cursor move left to fill the deleted
                                   character's position.

 CTRL+LEFT                         Moves the cursor left to the first
                                   character of a word. If the cursor is
                                   already positioned on the first
                                   character of a word or in the space
                                   between words, the cursor moves to the
                                   first character of the word to the left.
                                   .ET

 CTRL+RIGHT                        Moves the cursor right to the first
                                   character of the next word.

 CTRL+END                          Deletes any characters from the current
                                   cursor position to the end of the
                                   command line.

 CTRL+HOME                         Deletes any characters from the
                                   beginning of the command line up to (but
                                   not including) the current cursor
                                   position.

 ENTER                             Sends the information on the command
                                   line to the command interpreter and adds
                                   it to the list of commands in memory.
                                   Pressing ENTER also turns off insert
                                   mode.

 .RT For example, suppose the keys command is running and when you type keys
 list to see the list of commands in memory, the following list is displayed:


 1: cd accounts
 2: dir sales.feb
 3: copy a:\sales.feb
 4: cd ..
 5: path
 6: type sales.feb
 7: keys list


 Now suppose you want to use any of the keys editing functions. Press the UP
 key to bring the last command in the list to the command line. Press UP
 again to display the previous command. As you continue to press UP, the keys
 command takes you through the entire list and returns to the last command
 after reaching the beginning of the list.

 The keys command continues to add commands to the list until you type keys
 off on the command line or exit the OS/2 session in which it was started. To
 find out whether the keys command is on or off, type keys and press ENTER.

 You can also have MS OS/2 start the keys command every time you start or
 restart your system by placing the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 set keys=on




 Getting Help Information

 When you use cmd commands, error messages may appear on your screen. You can
 use the Help program to get an explanation of any error message. Each
 message consists of a number (for example, SYS1002) and a brief description
 of the error condition. For a more detailed explanation of the error
 condition, you type help followed by the message number. For example,
 suppose that when you try to get a directory list in wide format, you
 accidentally type dir /z instead of dir /w. You receive the following error
 message, "SYS1003: The syntax of the command is incorrect." To see a
 detailed explanation of this error message, type the following:

 help sys1003


 The following explanation is provided:

 SYS1003: The syntax of the command is incorrect.

 EXPLANATION: One of the following occurred:

 1. An incorrect parameter was specified.
 2. A required parameter is missing.
 3. Too many parameters were entered.
 4. The parameters were entered in the wrong order.
 ACTION: Check the syntax of the command. Then retry
 the command.





 Setting Up the System

 When you first set up your system, you may want to do such things as
 customize the MS OS/2 command prompt or set and display the date and the
 time of day. The cmd program contains several built-in commands that help
 you perform these types of tasks. This section describes the commands you
 might use when setting up your system. The commands are as follows:

 Command                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 cls                               Clears your screen.

 date                              Displays and sets the system date.

 time                              Displays and sets the system time.

 ver                               Displays the MS OS/2 version number.

 prompt                            Changes the cmd prompt.

 chcp                              Changes the current code page.

 These commands are described in the following sections.


 Clearing the Screen

 The cls command clears your computer screen. Once you clear the screen, you
 cannot retrieve the information. To use this command, type the following:

 cls


 Your screen clears, and the MS OS/2 command prompt appears in the upper-left
 corner of the screen.


 Setting and Displaying the Date

 You can set and display the system date by using the date command. MS OS/2
 uses this date to update the directory list whenever you create or change a
 file or directory. The date that you set applies to all sessions. To use the
 date command, type the following:

 date


 You'll see a message similar to this:

 The current date is Fri  3-24-1989
 Enter the new date: (mm-dd-yy) _


 To keep the current date, press ENTER. To change the date, type the new date
 at the cursor, separating the month, day, and year with hyphens (-), slashes
 (/), or periods (.). For example, the dates 6-1-89, 6/1/89, and 6.1.89 are
 equivalent.

 You can also specify the date directly after the date command, as follows:

 date 3-1-89



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If your system is set up for a country other than the United States, the
 date and time formats you use may differ from what is shown here. The
 country command in the CONFIG.SYS file sets this format. For more
 information about the country command, see Chapter 15, "Using MS OS/2
 Configuration Commands."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Setting and Displaying the Time

 You can set and display the system time with the time command. This command
 sets the internal clock in your computer. MS OS/2 uses this time to update
 the directory list whenever you create or change a file or directory. The
 time that you set applies to all sessions. To use the time command, type the
 following:

 time


 You'll see a message similar to this:

 The current time is: 10:21:39.03
 Enter the new time: _


 To keep the current time, press ENTER. To change the time, you type the new
 time at the cursor, separating hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a
 second with colons (:) or periods (.). The separator between seconds and
 hundredths of a second must be a period. The hour is based upon a 24-hour
 clock. Seconds and hundredths of a second are optional.

 You can also specify the time directly after the time command, as follows:

 time 13:30





 Displaying the Version Number

 To display the MS OS/2 version number, use the ver command. To use this
 command, type the following:

 ver





 Changing the Cmd Prompt

 You can change the way your prompt looks by using the prompt command. Prompt
 recognizes several character combinations, all of which begin with a dollar
 sign ($). Each character combination displays a different prompt. The prompt
 command affects only the current session. To change the prompt, you type
 prompt followed by one or more character combinations. For example, to
 change the prompt to an equal sign followed by a greater-than sign, type the
 following:

 prompt $q$g


 Now your prompt looks like this:

 =>


 You can use any of the following character combinations to create your
 prompt:

 Characters                        Prompt
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 $$                                Dollar sign ($)

 $t                                Current time

 $d                                Current date

 $p                                Current directory on the current drive

 $v                                Version number

 $n                                Current drive letter

 $g                                Greater-than sign (>)

 $l                                Less-than sign (<)

 $b                                Pipe symbol ( | )

 $_                                New line (the equivalent of pressing
                                   ENTER)

 $e                                ANSI escape character

 $q                                Equal sign (=)

 $h                                Backspace (to erase a character in the
                                   prompt)

 $i                                Help line

 $c                                Left parenthesis [ ( ] (in cmd only)

 $f                                Right parenthesis [ ) ] (in cmd only)

 $a                                Ampersand (&) (in cmd only)

 You can also change your prompt to any string of characters or combination
 of characters and symbols. For more information on how to change your prompt
 to a string of characters, see the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command
 Reference. If you type prompt by itself, the prompt changes to the default
 system prompt.


 Changing the Code Page

 To display or switch the current code page, use the chcp command. The code
 page defines a character correspondence table that is used to set up
 foreign-language versions of MS OS/2. Four code pages are supported:
 Multilingual (850), United States (437), Portuguese (860), and Canadian
 French (863).

 Before you can switch to a different code page, you must set up your system
 for code-page switching. This can be done during installation of MS OS/2.
 Or, you can modify your CONFIG.SYS file by following the instructions found
 in Chapter 15, "Using MS OS/2 Configuration Commands." To find out which
 code page is currently active and which code pages are prepared for your
 system, you type chcp by itself. You can switch to any code page that is
 prepared for your system. To switch to a different code page, type chcp and
 the number of the code page. For example, to switch to the Canadian French
 code page, type the following:

 chcp 863


 For a list of countries and their supported code pages, see Chapter 15,
 "Using MS OS/2 Configuration Commands."


 Managing Files, Directories, and Drives

 MS OS/2 provides several commands that help you manage files, directories,
 and drives. These commands, with their alternative forms shown in
 parentheses, are as follows:

 Command                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 dir                               Displays the contents of a directory.

 mkdir (md)                        Makes a new directory.

 chdir (cd)                        Switches to a different directory.



 Command                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 rmdir (rd)                        Removes a directory.

 type                              Displays the contents of a file.

 copy                              Copies a file.

 move                              Moves a file or directory.

 del (erase)                       Deletes a file.

 rename (ren)                      Renames a file or directory.

 vol                               Displays the volume identification of
                                   the current drive.

 Unless you specify otherwise, all commands that you type at the cmd prompt
 work with the contents of the current directory. Many of these commands
 accept options, which are letters preceded by a slash (/) and that modify
 how a command works. While most command options are described in this
 chapter, see the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference for a
 complete list and description of the options for each command.


 Displaying Directory Information

 To display a list of the contents of a directory, use the dir command. A
 directory list consists of individual directory entries, each of which
 describes one file or subdirectory (a directory created within another
 directory).

 You can display the directory list for your current directory, for a
 specific directory or file, for more than one directory, or for a group of
 files. In addition, the dir command can display the list in a
 multiple-column format or a page-by-page format. You can also choose the
 order in which the directory information is displayed. The various options
 are described in the following sections.

 Displaying the Contents of the Current Directory

 To display the contents of the current directory, you type the dir command
 without any arguments.

 For example, suppose you are working in a directory called FINANCE. To
 display the directory entries, type the following:

 dir


 The cmd command interpreter displays a list similar to the following:

  The volume label in drive C is RALPH.
  The Volume Serial Number is E392:1C15
  Directory of C:\eFINANCE

 .            <DIR>      1-30-89   9:10p
 ..           <DIR>      1-30-89   9:10p
 BUSINESS     <DIR>      1-30-89   9:11a
 PERSONAL     <DIR>      1-30-89   9:12a
 TAXES        <DIR>     10-15-89   8:47a
 1QUARTER SUM      452   4-20-89  10:31a
 2QUARTER SUM      590   7-27-89   9:05a
 3QUARTER SUM      524  10-08-89   3:54p
 REPORT   TXT     1168  11-08-89   2:15p
      9 File(s)   1880064 bytes free


 Here is what each directory entry contains:

   ş   The volume label and serial number of your current drive

   ş   The name of the current drive and directory

   ş   The filename and filename extension (if any) or the directory name

   ş   The size of the file (in bytes)

   ş   The date that the file or directory was created or last modified

   ş   The time that the file or directory was created or last modified


 Directories have <DIR> listed after their names. At the end of the list, dir
 displays the number of files in the directory and the number of bytes that
 are free on the disk. It is a good idea to check your available disk space
 regularly, especially if your disk space is limited.

 If you are viewing a directory list for a directory other than the root
 directory by using the file allocation table (FAT) file system, you'll see
 periods (. and ..) listed as directory entries. These characters are a
 shorthand notation for the current (.) and parent (..) directories. The
 current directory is the one you are now working in, and the parent
 directory is one level above the current directory in the directory
 structure. In the high-performance file system (HPFS), you'll see these
 entries in the root directory as well; because the root directory has no
 parent directory, the parent (..) notation listed there has no meaning.
 You can use this notation in any cmd command or utility to specify the
 current or parent directory. For example, to see the directory list for a
 parent directory, type the following:
 dir ..


 You can also display directory entries for the current directory on a
 different drive. For example, to see what is in the current directory on
 drive A, type the following:

 dir a:


 A list of the files and directories for drive A appears on your screen. You
 may want to see only a directory list of filenames, instead of the complete
 directory entries described previously. For a list of the filenames on drive
 A, type the following:

 dir a: /f


 When you use the /f option, the dir command also displays the complete
 directory path of the files.

 Viewing a Directory List for a Specific File or Directory

 The dir command lets you view any directory list without changing your
 current directory.

 To do this, you must tell cmd the path of the directory you want to view.
 You can specify the directory's full path from the root directory, or you
 can specify a relative path from your current directory. Although you can
 always type the full path of a directory, it is not required. For example,
 suppose you have your business-travel schedules stored in the TRAVEL
 subdirectory of the \FINANCE\BUSINESS directory. To view the files in your
 TRAVEL subdirectory from the root directory, type the following:

 dir \finance\business\travel


 However, if you are in the FINANCE directory, you only need to type the path
 from the current directory to the TRAVEL subdirectory:

 dir business\travel


 If you prefer to see your personal-travel schedules that are stored in the
 TRAVEL subdirectory of the \eFINANCE\ePERSONAL directory on drive A, type
 the following:

 dir a:\finance\personal\travel



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you will be doing much work in another directory, you can also use the
 chdir command to move to that directory before using the dir command. The
 chdir command is described in detail in "Changing to Another Directory,"
 later in this chapter.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 Displaying the Contents of Multiple Directories

 You can display directory lists for more than one directory by typing the
 name of each directory after the dir command. For example, suppose that you
 are planning to purchase new desks and lamps for your employees. Although
 you have price lists for many items in your current directory, you would
 like to see the lists that pertain only to desks and lamps. To see the
 directory lists for the DESKS directory, which is on your current drive, and
 the directory list for the LAMPS directory, which is on drive A, type the
 following:

 dir desks a:\lamps


 You will first see the list for DESKS, followed by the list for LAMPS:

  The volume label in drive C is RALPH.
  The Volume Serial Number is 2520:9C15
  Directory of C:\DESKS

 .            <DIR>      6-23-89   2:58p
 ..           <DIR>      6-23-89   2:58p
 STUDY    DSK      899   6-09-89  12:35p

 If the dir command cannot find one of the specified directories, it displays
 an error message telling you which directory could not be found and then
 displays the other directory.

 Displaying a Directory List for a Group of Files

 You might find that you want to view a directory list for a specific group
 of files. For example, to view a directory list in your current directory
 for all of the files that have the filename extension .DOC, type the
 following:

 dir *.doc


 The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character, which has a special meaning to
 cmd. The cmd program replaces the asterisk with any alphanumeric character
 or string of characters. In the previous example, the files REPORT.DOC,
 REPLY.DOC, and LETTER.DOC are all displayed.

 Wildcard characters can be used with the dir command to specify other groups
 of files. For example, to view all of the files that begin with the letter
 "R," type the following:

 dir r*


 This displays the files REPORT.DOC and REPLY.DOC, but not LETTER.DOC.

 To view all files beginning with the characters FIN, regardless of their
 filename extensions, type the following:

 dir fin*


 The files FINANCE.TXT, FIND.TXT, and FIN024.DAT are all included in the
 list. In addition to the asterisk, the question mark (?) can also be used as
 a wildcard character. A question mark in a filename or filename extension
 means that any one character or no character at all may occupy that
 position. For example, to display a directory list for trade shows that you
 have attended, you could type the following:

 dir show?.*


 You would see a list that contains SHOW.PDX, SHOW1.SEA, SHOWNSHOW3.LAX; it
 would, however, not include SHOW23.SEA (since the question mark stands for
 only one character).

 Displaying a Directory List in Wide Format

 If you have a large directory with many files, you might not be able to see
 all of the directory lists on one screen. One way to condense this list is
 to display it in wide (/w) format.

 Suppose that your ACCOUNTS directory contains files for every account you
 have. You want to see the names of all the accounts, but you know that it is
 a long list of names. To display the directory list in wide format, type the
 /w option on the command line:

 dir accounts /w


 You see a multiple-column list of the filenames in the directory, and they
 appear without the file size or date/time information.

 Viewing a Directory List in Page Format

 Just as you read a book one page at a time, you can view a directory list
 one screenful at a time. To do this, use the /p option: .ET

 dir accounts /p


 The first part of the directory list is displayed, then the message "Press
 any key when ready . . ." appears at the bottom of the screen when the
 screen is full. After you press a key, the second screenful of the list
 appears. This continues until all of the directory entries are displayed or
 until you press CTRL+C to stop the operation.

 You can also use the /w and /p options together. This option combination
 displays directory lists in wide format, one screenful at a time. .RT


 Creating a Directory

 You can create a directory by using the mkdir (md) command. You can create a
 directory under your current directory, or you can create a directory in a
 specified drive or location.

 MS OS/2 always creates the root directory (\) for you. But most users will
 require additional directories to store system and user files. You can
 create additional directories that branch out from the root directory into a
 multilevel directory structure. Directories created within other directories
 are sometimes referred to as subdirectories.

 Creating a Directory in the Current Directory

 To make a subdirectory in your current directory, type mkdir or md followed
 by the name of the new directory. For example, to create a new directory
 named INVOICE under the FINANCE directory, go to the FINANCE directory and
 type the following:

 md invoice


 If you now type dir, you'll see INVOICE listed as a directory:

 INVOICE <DIR>   6-1-89 4:44p




 Creating a Directory in a Specified Location

 You can also make a new directory anywhere you choose. This means that even
 if you are in the INVOICE directory on drive C, you can make a new directory
 named LETTERS on drive A. Just specify the drive and path of the new
 directory after the mkdir command, as follows:

 md a:\letters


 This creates a new directory on drive A named LETTERS.

 Creating Multiple Directories

 To save time, you can create more than one directory at once. For example,
 to create the SUPPLIES directory within your current directory and the
 EXPENSES directory within the root directory on drive A, type the following:


 md supplies a:\eexpenses


 This creates two directories: one on your current drive and one on drive A.
 If the mkdir command cannot create both directories, it displays an error
 message telling you which directory cannot be created, but continues to
 create the other directory.


 Changing to Another Directory

 If you want to work in a different directory,
 you can use the chdir (cd) command to change directories. To change to a
 subdirectory within the current directory, you type chdir or cd followed by
 the name of the subdirectory. For example, to change from the FINANCE
 directory to the INVOICE subdirectory, type the following:

 cd invoice


 To change to a directory somewhere else on the directory tree, you must
 specify the path of the directory.

 Moving to the Parent or Root Directory

 You have seen how the dir command uses periods to list the current (.) and
 parent (..) directories in a directory list. You can easily change to the
 current directory's parent directory by typing the following:

 cd ..


 Each time you type this command, you move one level closer to the root
 directory. For example, suppose you are in the MEMOS directory, the full
 path of which is \FINANCE\LETTERS\MEMOS. To return to the \FINANCE
 directory, type the following:

 cd ..\..


 This takes you out of the MEMOS subdirectory and moves you to the FINANCE
 directory. You can also combine the periods (..) with directory names to
 specify a directory. For example, suppose you are in the \LETTERS\WORK
 directory and you want to change to the \LETTERS\FAMILY directory. You could
 move up one level by typing cd .. and then type cd family to move down to
 the right directory. However, an easier way is to combine the two operations
 in one step, as follows:

 cd ..\family


 To quickly change to the root directory, regardless of where you are in the
 directory structure, type the following:

 cd \





 Removing a Directory

 The rmdir (rd) command removes a directory.

 Before you can remove a directory, you must delete all the files in the
 directory. You must also change to a directory other than the one you want
 to delete, since the cmd program will not let you delete a directory that
 you are currently in. For information on deleting, see "Deleting a File,"
 later in this chapter.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 You cannot remove the root directory, and you cannot remove directories that
 are being used in other sessions.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 Removing One Directory

 To remove one directory, you must be sure that the directory is empty and
 that you are in a different directory before you type rmdir or rd followed
 by the name of the directory you want to delete. For example, to delete the
 directory LETTERS, do the following:

   1.  If you are in the LETTERS directory, type cd .. to switch to the
       parent directory.

   2.  Type del letters\e* to delete all of the files in the directory. A
       message will appear, asking whether you are sure that you want to
       delete all files. Type Y to delete all files in the directory.

   3.  Type rd letters to remove the directory.



 Removing Multiple Directories

 To remove more than one directory, type the rd command, then specify each
 directory you want to remove, as follows:

 rd letters travel


 Make sure that each directory you want to remove is empty. If the rd command
 cannot remove both directories, it displays an error message telling you
 which directory could not be removed and continues to remove the other
 directory.


 Displaying the Contents of a File

 To display the contents of a data file, use the type command. For example,
 suppose that you have saved a letter in a file called MEMOJAN

 type memojan


 The contents of the file scroll on your screen:

 TO:             John Howard
 FROM:           Elizabeth Johnson
 SUBJECT:        Questionnaires
 DATE:           January 12, 1989

 The twenty questionnaires you sent to our
 department have been completed and are
 enclosed in the accompanying envelope.

 Thank you for encouraging us to participate
 in your survey. We look forward to learning
 the results!


 If the file is large, you may want to temporarily stop the text from
 scrolling on your screen. To do this, press CTRL+S. To resume scrolling,
 press CTRL+S again.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you have a large file that you want to view, you might want to use the
 more utility instead of the type command. The more utility displays the
 contents of a file one screenful at a time. For information about the more
 utility, see Chapter 9, "Using MS OS/2 Utilities."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 You can display more than one file at a time by adding additional filenames
 after the type command. For example, to display the files MEMOJANand MEMOFEB

 type memojan


 The contents of MEMOJANtents of MEMOFEBspecified files, it displays an error
 message telling you which file could not be found and continues to display
 the other file.

 You could also use wildcard characters to display several files. For
 example, to display the contents of all the files with the extension one
 after the other, type the following:

 type *




 You can also use redirection symbols with the type command. Redirection is a
 feature that lets you take the output from a command and send it to a file
 instead of to the screen. For information about redirection symbols, see
 "Redirecting Input, Output, and Error Messages," later in this chapter.


 Copying a File

 You can copy files from one location to another by using the copy command.
 In addition, copy can combine files and create files. Just specify a source
 file that will be copied and a destination file that will receive the copy.
 You can copy ASCII as well as binary files; the default setting is binary.

 Copying One File to Another

 To copy the contents of one file to another file, you type copy followed by
 the names of the source file and the destination file. For example, to copy
 the contents of the file OLD.TXT to the file NEW.TXT, type the following:

 copy old.txt new.txt


 If NEW.TXT does not currently exist, it is automatically created, then
 OLD.TXT is copied to it. If NEW.TXT does exist, it is replaced by the
 contents of OLD.TXT. Be careful when you copy the contents of a file to an
 existing file, since the contents of the existing file will become
 permanently lost.

 If you do not specify a directory path when using the copy command, MS OS/2
 copies files in the current directory. If you want to specify files in other
 directories, make sure that you include their directory paths. For example,
 to copy the contents of OLD.TXT in the current directory to NEW.TXT in drive
 A, type the following:

 copy old.txt a:new.txt


 To copy the contents of a file on drive A called INVOICE.DOC to your current
 directory and use the same filename, type the following:

 copy a:invoice.doc




 Copying a Group of Files

 You can use wildcard characters to copy a group of files to another group of
 files. For example, to copy the contents of all of the files in the current
 directory that have the filename extension .EXE to an identical set of files
 in drive A, type the following:

 copy *.exe a:


 You can also copy a group of files to a specific directory. For example, to
 copy the contents of all the .TXT files to the LETTERS subdirectory in the
 FINANCE directory, type the following:

 copy *.txt \finance\letters


 There may be times when you will want to copy an entire directory into
 another directory. For example, to copy all of the files in the current
 directory into the REPORTS directory in drive A, type the following:

 copy * a:\reports


 Be sure the destination directory exists; if it does not, MS OS/2 will
 create a file called REPORTS in the root directory on drive A, then copy the
 contents of all the files into that one file.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you want to copy the contents of an entire floppy disk onto another
 floppy disk, use the diskcopy utility, which is described in Chapter 9,
 "Using MS OS/2 Utilities."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 Appending a File to Another File

 In addition to copying files, the copy command can append one or more files
 to an existing file or combine them into a new file. To do this, list any
 number of files as arguments to the copy command. The files to be combined
 should be separated by plus signs (+), and you can specify a destination
 file that the combined files will be copied to. (The original files will
 still exist, unless you have made one of them the destination file.) For
 example, suppose that you want to combine two files named JANFEB

 copy jan


 When the operation is completed, cmd displays the following message: "1
 file(s) copied." The plus sign (+) between the files means that the contents
 of the FEBwill still exist in its original form.)

 You can combine several files and copy them to another file. So, if you want
 to add the contents of the files JANcalled WINTER

 copy jan


 If you specify a destination file when you append files, the destination
 file is created and given the current date and time. If you omit a
 destination file, MS OS/2 combines the files and stores them under the name
 of the file specified first.

 You can also combine several files into one file by using wildcard
 characters. The following command takes all files with the .TXT extension
 and combines them into one file named COMBIN

 copy *.txt combin


 In the following example, each file that has the extension .TXT is combined
 with its corresponding .REF file. The result in each case is a file with the
 same filename, but with the extension combined with VIDEO.REF to form
 VIDEOAUDIO.REF to form AUDIO

 copy *.txt+*.ref *




 If .TXT files do not correspond exactly with .REF files, existing files are
 copied singly to the

 The following copy command combines all of the files with the extension .TXT
 and all of the files with the extension .REF into one file named COMBIN

 copy *.txt+*.ref combin




 Creating a File

 In the previous examples, you have seen how to copy files to other files.
 But the copy command can also copy to a file what you type on the keyboard.
 You need only to specify con (for console) after the copy command. In MS
 OS/2, the keyboard is referred to as CON. For example, to create the file
 MESSAGE.TXT, type the following:

 copy con message.txt


 Then press ENTER and type the text of the message. For example, you could
 type the following:

 I have just received your shipment of invoices.
 Thanks for your prompt response.

 K. P. Smith


 To end the note and save it in the file, press CTRL+Z followed by ENTER. You
 will see a message saying "1 file(s) copied," then the command prompt again.


 If you use the dir command to view the directory entries, you will see that
 the file MESSAGE.TXT now appears in your directory.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 The copy command has four additional options. The /v option verifies a copy
 operation, the /a option copies ASCII files, the /b option copies binary
 files, and the /f option indicates that extended attributes should not be
 discarded if the destination file system does not support them. For more
 information on how to use these options, see the Microsoft Operating
 System/2 Command Reference.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 Preserving Extended Attributes

 In MS OS/2, some applications attach additional information, such as author,
 application type, and file history, to your files and directories. These
 pieces of information are called extended attributes and are used by other
 applications, the file system, or the operating system itself. For example,
 an application such as Microsoft Excel may look at a file's extended
 attributes to see if the file is a Microsoft Excel chart.

 Care must be taken when using the copy command to preserve any extended
 attributes. When you are simply making a copy of a file, the copy command
 preserves all extended attributes. However, when you are appending one or
 more files to an existing file or combining files into a new file, only the
 extended attributes of the first file specified are preserved.

 It is possible for a file to have zero length and yet still have extended
 attributes attached to the file. You can use the copy command to copy a file
 with zero length; the copy command copies and preserves these extended
 attributes.

 If you are copying a file that has extended attributes to a file system that
 does not support extended attributes, you may want to use the /f option with
 the copy command. For more information about using the copy command on files
 with extended attributes, see the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command
 Reference.

 You may want to use the eautil utility before copying files that have
 extended attributes. By using the eautil utility, you can split files and
 their extended attributes into separate files, copy the files, and then join
 the files together again. For information about the eautil utility, see the
 Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference.

 You can see whether your files have extended attributes by using the dir
 command with the /n option. If a file has extended attributes, the size of
 the attributes is displayed in the column before the filename. For example,
 to see if the files in the LIBRARY directory have extended attributes, type
 the following:

 dir /n


 You'll see a directory list similar to the one that follows. The number in
 the column before the filename tells you the size of its extended attributes
 (a zero tells you there are no extended attributes associated with that file
 or directory).

  The volume label in drive C is RALPH.
  The Volume Serial Number is E392:1C15

     4 File(s)     1646592 bytes free





 Moving Files and Directories

 You can move files and directories from one location to another on the same
 drive by using the move command. You may want to move files and directories
 when organizing them on your hard disk.

 Moving a File

 To move the file SCHEDULE.TXT from the MONTHLY directory on drive C to the
 HISTORY directory on that same drive, type the following:

 move c:\monthly\schedule.txt \history


 In this example, the file is simply moved; its name stays the same. You can,
 however, move a file to another directory and give it a new name at the same
 time. Just specify the new filename after the directory name.

 You can use wildcard characters with the move command to move multiple files
 or directories, just as you can use them with the copy command.

 Moving a Directory

 You can also move a directory and its entire contents to another location on
 the same drive. Suppose you want to move the UTILITY directory on drive C
 into the directory OS12. To do this, type the following:

 move c:\utility \os12


 In this example, the UTILITY directory becomes a subdirectory of the OS12
 directory.


 Deleting a File

 Just as you may want to make copies of files or move files around, you also
 may want to remove files. When you want to delete a file from a disk, you
 can use the del or erase command.

 Deleting One File

 You can delete one file from a directory by typing del or erase followed by
 the name of the file. For example, to delete the file OLD.TXT from the root
 directory in drive A, type the following:

 del a:\old.txt


 Use the dir command to verify that the file has been deleted. It is a good
 idea to go through your directories and delete unnecessary files
 periodically. Unnecessary files take up valuable disk space.

 Deleting Multiple Files

 You can delete more than one file at a time by typing more than one filename
 on the del command line. For example, to delete the file OLD.TXT from the
 root directory in drive A, the file OLD2.TXT from the root directory of
 drive B, and the file OLD3.TXT from the root directory of drive C, type the
 following:

 del a:\old.txt b:\old2.txt c:\old3.txt


 If the del command cannot find one of the specified files, it displays a
 message telling you which file could not be found and continues deleting the
 other files.

 You can also use wildcard characters to delete a group of files. For
 example, suppose you are closing out your accounts with a particular vendor
 named New Moon Supplies. Your current directory contains a variety of files
 that record business transactions with this vendor:

 budget.jan
 budget.feb
 newmoon.inv
 newmoon.acc
 newmoon.1
 newmoon.2
 newmoon
 report


 To delete all files starting with the filename NEWMOON, type the following:

 del newmoon.*


 Your directory now looks like this:

 budget.jan
 budget.feb
 report


 Or, to delete all of the files in your current directory, type the
 following:

 del *


 When you try to delete all of the files in a directory, the following
 message appears: "Are you sure (Y/N)?" If you type Y and then press ENTER,
 the files will be deleted. If you type N, the files will not be deleted, and
 you will be returned to the prompt.

 If you are not sure that you want to delete every file in the directory, you
 can use the del command with the /p option. With this option specified, cmd
 prompts you file by file, giving you the option of deleting the file or
 continuing with the next.

 Use wildcard characters with careÄremember that deletions are permanent.


 Renaming a File or Directory

 Occasionally, you may want to change the name of a file or directory. You
 can use the rename (ren) command to do this. For example, to change the name
 of the file ADSSPONSORS

 ren c:\ads


 You can also rename a group of files. To rename all the files in the current
 directory that have the extension .TXT so that they have the extension type
 the following:

 ren *.txt *


 When you are renaming files and directories, keep these points in mind:

   ş   You cannot use rename to move a file to a different drive or
       directory.

   ş   You cannot rename a file or directory by using a name that already
       exists.




 Changing to Another Drive

 To change to another drive, you type the drive letter followed by a colon
 (:). For example, if the current drive is drive C and you want to switch to
 drive D, type the following:

 d:


 This switches to the current directory on drive D.


 Displaying the Volume Identification

 Each disk has a volume label, which is a name you assign to the disk during
 formatting. You might want to give a floppy disk a unique label to help you
 identify the disk later. Also, if you have set up logical drives, the volume
 label assigned to each of those drives can describe the contents of the
 drive (for example, drive D might be called SMITH and drive E be called
 JONES).

 If a disk has been formatted using MS OS/2 version 1.2, it also has a volume
 serial number. This number is a unique number assigned by MS OS/2, and it
 can be changed only by reformatting the disk. To view the volume
 identification for your current disk, type the following:

 vol


 You can also view the volume identification for a different disk, such as
 the one on drive A, by typing the drive letter after the vol command:

 vol a:


 You can view the volume identification for more than one drive at a time by
 typing more than one drive letter after the vol command:

 vol a: c:


 If the vol command cannot find one of the specified drives, it displays an
 error message telling you which drive could not be found and continues to
 display information for the other drive.

 You can set the volume label by using the label utility, which is described
 in Chapter 9, "Using MS OS/2 Utilities."


 Running Programs

 You can run programs such as applications and utilities from cmd. This
 section describes how to start a program, as well as how to set up the
 proper environment to run a program and how to modify standard input (input
 from the keyboard), standard output (output to the screen), and standard
 error (error messages). This section also describes what happens when you
 start different types of programs from cmd.


 Starting a Program from Cmd

 When you start a program from cmd, the program runs in a full screen or in a
 window, depending on the type of program. Use the following information to
 start a program from cmd and to determine the environment that the program
 will run in. To start a program from cmd, do the following:

   ş   At the prompt, type the command that starts the program, followed by
       any arguments, and press ENTER.


 For example, suppose that you want to prepare the payroll checks for your
 employees by using a spreadsheet program named SP. To start the program,
 type the program's start command, in this case sp, and then press ENTER.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 See your program's manual for the specific command that starts the program.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 After your program starts, the output you see on the screen depends upon the
 type of program you are running. Some full-screen programs, for instance,
 can run in a window as well as in a full screen. If you start them from cmd
 in a window, they run in a window; if you start them from cmd in a
 full-screen session, they run in a full screen. Presentation Manager
 applications, on the other hand, run in a window even if you start them from
 cmd in a full screen. The following list shows the various types of MS OS/2
 programs you can run from cmd and what their output looks like depending on
 where you start them:

   Program type                    Started     Started from cmd in a full
                                   from cmd    screen
                                   in a
                                   window.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Full-screen only                  Full-scree  Full-screen output
                                   n output

 Full-screen or window             Window      Full-screen output

                                   message

 In MS OS/2, DOS programs can be run only in the DOS session.

 Starting a Presentation Manager Application

 You can start a Presentation Manager application from cmd when it is running
 in a full screen or in a window. After you type the name of the command and
 press ENTER, your application starts to run in a new Presentation Manager
 window.

 While you are running the application, you will not be able to see the cmd
 prompt at all, even though cmd continues to run your application behind the
 scenes. When you quit your application, the application's window disappears
 and the cmd prompt reappears.

 Starting a Full-Screen Program That Can Run in a Window

 Some full-screen OS/2 programs can run either in a full screen or in a
 window. You can start these programs from cmd in a full-screen session or
 from cmd in a window.

 When the program is started from a full-screen session, it takes up the
 entire screen until you quit the program. When the program is started from
 cmd in a window, it runs in that same window (not in a new window). After
 you quit your program, the cmd prompt reappears.

 Starting a Full-Screen Program That Must Run in a Full Screen


 Some full-screen OS/2 programs are designed to be started from cmd when it is
 running in a full screen. If you start the program from cmd running in a
 window, the program's output appears on the full screen, then switches back
 to the window after the program is finished running.
 Many programs display output on the full screen for only a few moments
 before switching back to the window. If this happens, start cmd running in a
 full screen and then start your program.

 Setting the PATH and Other Environment Variables

 Starting a program from cmd is identical to using commands, except that you
 must be in the directory where the program is located or you must have set
 the PATH environment variable to include that directory. The PATH
 environment variable specifies which directories MS OS/2 will search for
 programs you start. If you add your program's directory to the search path,
 MS OS/2 can find and start your program regardless of which directory you
 are currently working in.

 You might also need to set other environment variables, such as DPATH, LIB,
 or TMP, depending on whether your program requires them. For information on
 setting environment variables, see "Setting Up the Environment," later in
 this chapter.


 Starting a Program with the Start Command

 The start command lets you start a program in a new full-screen session or
 in a new window (but not in the DOS session). Start provides an alternative
 to the Desktop Manager, and also lets you start programs from a batch file.
 Various options to start provide you with different ways to start programs.
 To start a new program, you type start followed by the name of the program.
 If you type start by itself, cmd starts running in a new window.
 You can also specify a program title and options. The start command's
 options are described in the following sections. If you do not supply
 options, start will determine the type of program you want to start
 (full-screen or Presentation Manager) and then start the program in the
 appropriate session.

 If you start a program with the start command from a full screen or in a
 window running cmd, a new window is created for your program (if the program
 can run in a window). If the program cannot run in a window, a new
 full-screen session is created to run your program. Once programs start
 running, you can stop them at any time by pressing CTRL+C.

 The new program starts in a background session, not in the one you are
 currently working in. You will need to switch to that session or window
 before you can view the program or work with it. (See "Starting a Foreground
 Program," later in this chapter, for an alternate way to make a new program
 appear on your screen.)

 Specifying a Program Title

 To specify a program title for the new program, type the title, enclosed in
 quotation marks, immediately after the start command. This title will be
 displayed in the title bar of the window where the program is running, as
 well as among the programs in the Task List.

 For example, suppose that you want to start a program called SP and you want
 to give it the program title "Harris Co. Spreadsheet." To specify the
 program title when you start the program, type the following:

 start "Harris Co. Spreadsheet" sp


 You will see SP start in a window. The title bar and the Task List entry for
 SP both will say "Harris Co. Spreadsheet."

 Using Start in Batch Programs

 The start command is used most often in batch programs for activities such
 as starting programs during system start-up. If you know that you want a
 particular program to run every time you start MS OS/2, you may want to use
 the start command in a start-up program. For more information about batch
 programs, see Chapter 11, "Using MS OS/2 Batch Programs." For information
 about start-up programs, see Chapter 14, "Using Start-Up Files in MS OS/2."

 Causing Cmd to End Automatically

 By using the /c option, you can cause cmd to end after a program finishes
 running. Normally, after a program that was started with the start command
 finishes running, the new session or window that was created does not
 disappear. When you specify the /c option, the new full-screen session or
 window closes after the program ends.

 You can use this option to start a program without keeping an extra copy of
 cmd running. For example, suppose you want to run the chkdsk utility when
 you start or restart MS OS/2 and place the status report for drive D in a
 file named STATUS. You could type the following line in your STARTUP.CMD
 file:

 start /c chkdsk d: > c:status


 If you do not specify otherwise, MS OS/2 will create a file named STATUS on
 your start-up drive (usually drive C). For more information on STARTUP.CMD,
 see Chapter 14, "Using Start-Up Files in MS OS/2."

 If you have put this line in your STARTUP.CMD file, every time STARTUP.CMD
 is run, the start command starts the cmd program in a new window, runs
 chkdsk, saves the chkdsk status information in the STATUS file, and then
 closes the window. You can then view the STATUS file to see the status
 information for drive D.

 Starting a Program in a Full Screen

 To start a program in a full-screen session, you use the /fs option. Some
 programs are designed to be run only in a full screen. If you start these
 from cmd running in a window, these programs display their output in a full
 screen, then switch back to the window, making the output unreadable. The
 /fs option guarantees that when you start a full-screen program in a window,
 the program will run in a full screen.

 Starting a Foreground Program



 You can start a program that you want displayed on your screen by specifying
 the /f option. This way, when the program starts, you can see it running in
 the session or window you are currently working in.
 Other Options to the Start Command

 The start command has several other options, which are described in the
 following list. For details about these options, see the Microsoft Operating
 System/2 Command Reference.

 Option                            Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 /k                                Preserves the new session or window
                                   after the program ends. This is the
                                   default setting.

 /n                                Causes a program to start without first
                                   starting cmd.

 /win                              Specifies that the program will be run
                                   in a window. ,

 /pm                               Specifies that a Presentation Manager
                                   application will be started.

 /i                                Causes the newly started copy of cmd to
                                   inherit the environment specified in
                                   your CONFIG.SYS file. The /i option is
                                   described in "Inheriting the Environment
                                   of the Session," later in this chapter.

 /pgm                              Specifies that the quoted string
                                   following this option is the name of the
                                   program to be run.



 Starting a Background Program with the Detach Command

 To start programs that are not visible on your screen when they run, use the
 detach command. These background programs are processed, but they do not run
 in a session. This means that you cannot provide input to them (such as
 typing commands), and they do not display output. In addition, detached
 programs do not appear in the Task List. To detach a program, you type
 detach followed by the name of the background program you want to run. For
 example, suppose you have a program called archive that you use to make
 archive copies of some of your files. To run the archive program as a
 detached program, you would type the following:

 detach archive c:\archive\olddocs.arc c:\*.doc


 In this example, the archive program would run as a detached program, and it
 would copy all of your document files in the root directory of drive C to a
 file called OLDDOCS.ARC in the ARCHIVE directory of drive C.

 Once you start a background program, MS OS/2 displays the message "The
 Process Identification Number is nn" and then displays the cmd prompt again.
 After the prompt appears, you can continue to type commands and run programs
 while your background program runs.

 Programs that can run without user input or that take a long time to run are
 good candidates for use as background programs. That way, you do not need to
 have cmd running in a full screen or window just to start one program. It is
 a good idea to avoid unnecessary full-screen sessions or Presentation
 Manager windows, because extra sessions and windows slow down the
 performance of your computer.

 Since you cannot see the output of a background program, you should redirect
 the output to a file or device. For example, suppose that you want an
 alphabetical list of a very large list of names. The following command
 starts a background program that reads the names from the file NAMES, sorts
 them, and writes them to the file SORT.DIR:

 detach sort < names > sort.dir


 While this is taking place behind the scenes, you can continue to run
 another program from the cmd prompt displayed on your screen. For a detailed
 explanation of redirection symbols (>, <, or >) and the pipe ( | ), see
 "Redirecting Input, Output, and Error Messages," later in this chapter.


 Setting Up the Environment

 The environment consists of a collection of variables used by
 the system. These variables, called environment variables, are user-defined
 and can be assigned values of your choosing. There are environment
 variables, such as PATH and DPATH, that are commonly used by programs, and
 you can also define your own environment variables.

 When you start a program from cmd, the system searches for the program in
 the directories specified by the PATH environment variable. Some programs
 also use the DPATH environment variable, which specifies the data search
 path to use. If you are a programmer, you might need to set the LIB (library
 search path) and INCLUDE (include-file search path) environment variables.

 This section describes how to set up the PATH and DPATH environment
 variables, as well as how to use the set command. For more information about
 environment variables, see Chapter 15, "Using MS OS/2 Configuration
 Commands."

 Displaying Your Path

 After you install your programÄbut before you run itÄyou may need to modify
 your PATH environment variable. The MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd, uses
 this variable to search for programs that you start from cmd. When you type
 a command to start a program, cmd first searches your current directory for
 the program. If it does not find it there, cmd searches the first directory
 listed by the PATH environment variable, then the second, and so on, until
 the program is found or all directories listed have been searched. When MS
 OS/2 is first installed on your system, a default PATH setting is assigned
 automatically and stored in your environment along with other environment
 variables. You can view your path by typing the following:

 path


 You can also view the values assigned to other environment variables by
 typing set by itself.

 You can always run a program if you are already in the directory where the
 program is installed or if you specify the exact path of the program on the
 command line. It is usually easier, however, to modify your path so that you
 can run your program while you are in any directory.

 Setting Your Path


 To modify the PATH environment variable, you can use the path command. To use
 this command, type path followed by the directories that you want in your
 search path. Separate directory names with a semicolon (;).
 For example, suppose you want to add the APPS directory to your search path.
 Your current path is set to the OS2 directory and several of its
 subdirectories. You can type the following to set the new path:

 path c:\os2;c:\os2\dll;c:\os2\system;c:\os2\intro;c:\apps


 Restarting MS OS/2 will remove path assignments made with the path command.

 In addition to the path command, you can also use the set command to set
 your search path (described in the following sections). Or, you can set your
 path by using the set configuration command. See Chapter 15, "Using MS OS/2
 Configuration Commands," for information on how to use this command.

 Setting Up a Data Search Path

 You can set up a search path for data files by using the dpath command. Just
 as the path command tells cmd where to locate program files, the dpath
 command tells programs where to locate data files. A data file is any file
 not having the file extension .EXE, (in a full-screen session or in cmd
 running in a window), or .BAT (in the DOS session). For example, to tell MS
 OS/2 to search for data files first in your current directory and then in
 the ACCOUNTS directory, type the following:

 dpath accounts



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 Not all programs use the DPATH variable in their data searches. If it is not
 used, DPATH is ignored.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 Setting an Environment Variable

 To set environment variables, you can use the set command. You set
 environment variables by typing set followed by the name of the variable, an
 equal sign (=), and the value. (For more information on environment
 variables, see "Setting Up the Environment," earlier in this chapter.) To
 view your current environment, type set by itself. You will see a list of
 environment variables and the values that are assigned to them.

 The form a value takes depends on what the variable is and what it is used
 for. For example, while the PATH variable requires directory paths, the
 PROMPT variable requires the special characters that define the way the
 prompt looks. To define or redefine an environment variable, you type set
 followed by the name of the variable, an equal sign (=), and the value. If
 you want to define an environment variable called TEMP and assign the TEMP
 directory on drive C to it, type the following:

 set temp=c:\temp


 If you type set by itself, the TEMP variable appears in the list.

 In most cases, however, you will want to append, not override, any new
 values to your existing settings. For example, suppose that your current
 path looks like this:

 PATH C:\OS2;C:\OS2\DLL;C:\OS2\SYSTEM;C:\OS2\INTRO


 Also, suppose that you have just installed a spreadsheet program called SP
 in the directory APPS, and you want to be able to run your program from any
 directory. You could add the APPS directory to the search path by typing the
 existing path, then adding the APPS directory to the end of the list. An
 easier way, however, is to use a variable in the set command. To append a
 value to your path, type the following:

 set path=%path%;c:\apps


 The %path% variable is replaced by the existing path, and APPS is appended
 to the end of the list. After you have set your path, verify that it has
 been added by typing set again.

 Deleting a Setting

 To delete the current setting for an environment variable, you type set
 followed by the name of the variable and an equal sign (=), but you do not
 type a value to be assigned to the variable. For example, to delete the
 DPATH environment variable and its current setting from your environment,
 type the following:

 set dpath=




 Inheriting the Environment of the Session

 To start a new copy of cmd in a window and have it inherit the environment
 that was set up when you started your system, use the start command with the
 /i option. Normally, when you type start, the new copy of cmd inherits the
 environment of the current session. Since you can change the environment at
 any time by using the path and set commands, your current environment may
 not be the same as the one that you originally set up in the CONFIG.SYS
 file. To cause a new copy of cmd to inherit the environment set up in your
 CONFIG.SYS file, type the following:

 start /i


 Cmd starts to run in a new window. Now, if you type set by itself, you will
 see that the new environment is identical to the environment set in
 CONFIG.SYS. (For information about environment variables set in CONFIG.SYS,
 see Chapter 15, "Using MS OS/2 Configuration Commands." For more information
 about the start command, see "Starting a Program with the Start Command,"
 earlier in this chapter.)


 Redirecting Input, Output, and Error Messages

 When an MS OS/2 program runs, it usually receives input and
 produces output. For example, the output of the dir command is a directory
 list that is usually displayed on your screen. In addition, if the system
 encounters errors while running a program, it displays error messages.

 MS OS/2 programs can receive input from different devices, such as a
 keyboard, a disk file, or a modem. Similarly, programs can send their output
 and error messages to different destinations, such as a computer screen, a
 disk file, or a printer. .AR 19.5P

 By default setting, MS OS/2 programs receive input from the keyboard and
 send output to the screen.

 Information that you type at the keyboard is called standard input, or
 STDIN, and the information that is sent to the screen is called standard
 output, or STDOUT. In addition, if the system encounters an error condition,
 it normally sends error messages to the screen. This is called the standard
 error, or STDERR.

 If you want MS OS/2 to have input come from a source other than the
 keyboard, or have output or error messages sent to a device other than the
 screen, you can use two powerful features of MS OS/2: redirection symbols
 and pipes.

 Redirection symbols (>, <, or >) let you change the way that MS OS/2 deals
 with input and output. Instead of taking input from the keyboard, for
 example, you could direct MS OS/2 to access data from a file on your disk.
 Instead of displaying output on the screen, you could send the program's
 output or error messages to a printer. Pipes ( | ) let you take the output
 of one program and use it as the input to another program. The uses of
 redirection symbols and pipes are described further in the following
 sections.

 To keep track of data and to identify files, MS OS/2 uses file handles, and
 some of these can be redirected. By default setting, STDIN has the value (or
 handle) of 0, STDOUT has the value of 1, and STDERR has the value of 2. File
 handles 0 through 9 can be redirected by using the MS OS/2 command
 interpreter, cmd. File handles 3 through 9 must have been assigned by a
 program before they can be redirected.

 Pipes and redirection symbols can be used alone or in combination to change
 where input is read from and where output and error messages are written to.
 This lets you redirect input, output, and error messages to a file or device
 other than the keyboard or the screen.


 Saving Program Output in a File

 Instead of displaying messages on the screen, you can have those messages
 sent to a file on your disk. To redirect the standard output (STDOUT) to a
 file, you use a greater-than sign (>) in your command. Unless you specify a
 number before the greater-than sign, the standard output (handle 1) is
 assumed. This means that > and 1> are equivalent.

 For example, to redirect the output of the dir command to a file named
 DIRLIST.TXT, type the following:

 dir > dirlist.txt


 Now, if you use the type command to view DIRLIST.TXT, you will see that the
 directory list appears in the file. If the filename you specify does not
 already exist, MS OS/2 creates a new file and stores your directory list in
 it. However, if the filename does already exist, MS OS/2 replaces what is in
 the file with the new data (the old contents of the file are lost), so be
 sure not to specify the name of an existing file that you want to keep.


 Sending Program Output to a Device

 You can also redirect standard output to a device. For example, if you want
 to send your directory list to a printer that is attached to your computer's
 first parallel port (LPT1), type the following:

 dir > \dev\lpt1


 Or, to send your list to a terminal that is attached to your computer's
 first serial communications port (COM1), type the following:

 dir > \dev\com1


 Remember that your devices must be installed and running properly before you
 can redirect output to them.

 Finally, if your program sends output to handles 3 through 9, you can
 redirect standard output to a file or device by specifying the handle number
 before the greater-than sign. For example, if you typed myprog 3> outfile,
 this would take any output from MYPROG that is sent to handle 3 and send it
 to OUTFILE.


 Appending Output to a File

 If you
 want to add standard output to a file (instead of replacing the entire
 file), you can use two greater-than signs (>) to tell MS OS/2 to append the
 output of the command (such as a directory list) to the end of the file you
 specify. For example, to append your directory list to an existing file
 named NEWLIST.TXT, type the following:

 dir > newlist.txt


 When you redirect output with two greater-than signs (>), the existing
 contents of the file are not overwritten.


 Reading Input from a File

 If you want your program to read input from a file, use a less-than sign (<)
 in your command. Unless you enter a number before the less-than sign,
 standard input (handle 0) is assumed. This means that < and 0< are
 equivalent.

 It is often useful to have the input for a command come from a source other
 than the keyboard, such as from a file. For example, suppose you have a file
 called NAMESnot in alphabetical order, you could sort the file's contents by
 typing the following:

 sort < names


 The sort utility takes the contents of NAMESdisplays the newly sorted
 contents alphabetically on the screen.


 Reading Input from One File and Saving the Output in Another

 You can have a program both read input from a file and save output in
 another file by combining redirection symbols. For example, to sort the
 addresses in the client list in ADDRESSCLIENTS.ADD, type the following:

 sort < address


 Thus, ADDRESSthe output.


 Saving Error Messages in a File

 By default setting, MS OS/2 displays error messages (STDERR) on your screen.
 It is sometimes helpful, however, to store them in a file. That way, you
 have a permanent record of any errors you encounter while running a program.
 Suppose you are planning to copy all of the files on drive C that contain
 the filename extension .TXT to drive A. To do this and to create a file to
 hold the error messages that may appear while the files are being copied,
 type the following:

 copy *.txt a: 2> logfile.mes


 Any error messages that the operating system sends out during the copying
 operation are now stored in the file LOGFILE.MES. If you use the type
 command to view LOGFILE.MES, you will see the error messages that would
 normally be displayed on your screen. In this case, the message might be
 "SYS0002: The system cannot find the file specified." You must use the
 number 2 before the redirection symbol to specify that the error messages,
 not the command's output, are redirected to LOGFILE.MES.


 Sending Both Output and Error Messages to One File

 If you want your log file to contain both standard output and standard error
 messages, you can redirect them both to the same output device or file. This
 can be useful when you run a detached program, since you cannot view the
 output from background programs while they are running. After the detached
 program finishes running, you can view an output file that contains output
 and error messages that would normally have been displayed on your screen if
 the program had been running in a session. For example, if you want to use
 the dir command to list all of the .TXT files that are on your current
 drive. To send both the standard output standard output (handle 1) and the
 standard-error messages (handle 2) to the file LOGFILE.MES, type the
 following:

 dir *.txt > logfile.mes 2>&1


 In this example, "2>&1" tells MS OS/2 that any output written to handle 2
 will have the same effect as if it were written to handle 1. Therefore, the
 LOGFILE.MES file will contain both the output of the dir command and any
 error messages. The order of the symbols and arguments in the command is
 very important here: "2>&1" must follow the name of the file.


 Sending Output and Error Messages to Different Files


 If you want output or error messages to be directed to two different files,
 specify the filenames separately:
 dir *.txt > outfile.doc 2> errfile.doc


 Now, any output from the dir command is in OUTFILE.DOC, and error messages
 are in ERRFILE.DOC.


 Taking Output from One Program and Sending It to Another

 Another way you can manipulate input and output is by using pipes. Pipes
 work by taking the output of one command and using it as the input for the
 next command. Using pipes saves time, since you can run two, three, or more
 programs from a single command line.

 Piped commands are separated by the pipe symbol ( | ). When you use pipes,
 the first command on the command line runs as usual. The output of the first
 command is piped (that is, used as input) to the command that follows the
 first pipe symbol. The second command then runs, using the piped input. This
 program is repeated until all of the piped commands are processed. By using
 pipes, you could process the same set of data in several different ways.

 For example, to view a sorted directory list of the current directory, type
 the following:

 dir | sort


 The dir command is carried out, and the output (the directory list) is piped
 to the sort utility. Then, the sort utility sorts the output, and the screen
 displays an alphabetically sorted directory list.


 Tasks That Use Redirection Symbols and Pipes


 You can use redirection symbols and pipes to perform many tasks. The
 following examples show just a few possible uses.
 Sorting a Directory List and Saving It in a File

 By combining the pipe and redirection symbols, you can pipe the output of
 one command to another command and then save the output in a file. A useful
 technique is to pipe two commands together and send the output to a file.
 For example, the following command creates a file named DIRECT.LST in your
 working directory:

 dir | sort > direct.lst


 The DIRECT.LST file now contains a sorted list of the working directory.

 You can also specify a drive other than the default drive. For example,
 suppose you want to create the file DIRECT.LST on drive B and send the
 sorted data to it. To do this, type the following:

 dir | sort > b:direct.lst




 Printing a Sorted Phone List

 As you have already seen, you can redirect both the input and the output of
 a program. It is sometimes useful to print the output of a program. For
 example, if you wanted to sort a phone list and then print out the sorted
 list, you could type the following:

 sort < phone.lst > \dev\lpt1


 The contents of the file PHONE.LST first become the input for the sort
 utility and then become the output to a printer attached to LPT1.

 Reassigning Standard Input and Standard Output

 You can assign standard input and output to a different keyboard and
 terminal. For example, to assign standard input and output to the keyboard
 and terminal attached to COM1, type the following:

 cmd < \dev\com1 > \dev\com1


 This would allow you to run cmd on your computer from a remote terminal.
 This is similar to the ctty command in the MS-DOS operating system.

 Preventing Error Messages from Being Displayed

 If you do not want error messages to be displayed on your screen, you can
 redirect them to NUL. Anything sent to NUL is discarded. To send error
 messages to NUL, type the following:

 cmd 2> \dev\nul


 This command starts a new command interpreter (cmd) and sends all error
 messages to NUL.

 Piping Several Commands Together

 You can pipe several commands together. For example, to sort several phone
 lists and display the sorted output one screenful at a time, you could type
 the following:

 type *.lst | sort | more


 All of the phone lists having the filename extension .LST are sent as output
 together to be sorted and then displayed one screenful at a time.

 Introduction

 MS OS/2 provides programs called utilities to help you work with directories
 and data files, maintain disks, print files, change your keyboard layout,
 and display Help information.

 Utilities can run in either a full screen or in a window; you can start them
 from the MS OS/2 command interpreter (cmd) in a full screen, from cmd in a
 window, or from Desktop Manager. The examples in this chapter assume that
 you are in a full-screen session and have started cmd.

 In addition, most of these utilities can run in the DOS session. Chapter 10,
 "Using the DOS Session," describes which of the utilities in this chapter
 can be run in the DOS session and which ones must be run in a full-screen or
 Presentation Manager session.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 All examples of filenames and directory names in this chapter use the file
 allocation table (FAT) file system, which is the file system used by DOS and
 MS OS/2 versions 1.1 and earlier. For information on using high-performance
 file system (HPFS) filenames and directory names, see Chapter 16, "Using the
 High-Performance File System."

 Starting a Utility

 If you run certain utilities often, you might want to add them to Desktop
 Manager. That way, you can run the utility directly from Desktop Manager
 without having to start the cmd program. See Chapter 2, "Running
 Applications with MS OS/2," for details on how to add programs to Desktop
 Manager. For more information about running programs and commands from cmd,
 see Chapter 8, "Running Cmd." You can also start a utility from Desktop
 Manager, if the utility appears on the list of programs that can be started.
 Do the following:

       Mouse 

   ş   Double-click the name of the utility.


 Some utilities are designed to be run from a full screen. If they are run
 from a cmd window, these utilities will display their output on the full
 screen, then they will switch back to the window when the utility is
 finished running. This may happen so quickly that you won't have time to
 read the full-screen output. If this happens, switch to a full-screen
 session and start the utility again. To start a utility from the cmd prompt,
 do the following:

       Keyboard 

   ş   At the prompt, type the name of the program you want to start,
       followed by any command-line arguments, and press ENTER.




 Getting Help Information


 To display Help information about warning or error messages that you may see
 on your screen, use the MS OS/2 Help batch program. Each of these messages
 consists of a number (for example, SYS1041) and a brief description of the
 error condition. For a more detailed explanation of the error condition, you
 type help followed by the message number. For example, suppose that you
 receive the error message, "SYS0002: The system cannot find the file
 specified." To see a detailed explanation of this error message, type the
 following:
 help sys0002


 The message number can be shortened to 0002, or just 2, such that you only
 need to type help 2 on the command line. A more detailed explanation of the
 possible problem and the action you might take to correct the problem appear
 on your screen:

 SYS0002: The system cannot find the file specified.


 EXPLANATION: The file named in the command
 does not exist in the current directory or search path
 specified. Or, the filename was entered incorrectly.
 ACTION: Retry the command using the correct filename.





 Working with Disks

 MS OS/2 provides the following utilities to help you work with disks:

 Utility                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 format                            Formats a disk.

 diskcopy                          Copies the contents of a floppy disk to
                                   another floppy disk.



 Utility                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 label                             Assigns a volume label to a disk.

 diskcomp                          Compares the contents of two floppy
                                   disks.

 These utilities are described in the following sections.


 Formatting a Floppy Disk

 Before you can use a floppy disk, you must prepare it for use by
 using the format utility. You can also format a previously formatted disk.
 Formatting a disk erases all of its contents.

 Before you format your disk, make sure that you know what type of disk you
 have and what type of disk drive is in your computer. The following list
 shows the types of floppy disks that can be formatted with the format
 utility:

 Disk size                         Type
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 5-inch                            360-kilobyte (low-density)

 5-inch                            1.2-megabyte (high-density)

 3-inch                            720-kilobyte (low-density)

 3-inch                            1.44-megabyte (high-density)

 With the default setting, the format utility will format a disk according to
 the size and type of drive in your computer. If you do not specify options,
 and if your computer has a low-density drive, the format utility functions
 as though you are formatting a low-density disk; if your computer has a
 high-density drive, format functions as though you are formatting a
 high-density disk. (If your computer has more than one type of drive, the
 density level that format sets itself to process will depend on which drive
 you tell format to use.) Later in this section, you'll learn about options
 that override the default setting.

 Formatting a 5-Inch Disk

 To format a 5-inch disk (low- or high-density) in a disk drive of the same
 size, you type format followed by the letter of the drive that contains the
 disk. If you want to format a disk in drive A, type the following:

 format a:


 A message will then appear, asking you to insert a floppy disk in drive A
 and press ENTER, at which point formatting will begin. Usually, disks are
 given a volume label that identifies the disk. This label can be up to 11
 characters in length. After a disk is formatted, the format utility
 automatically prompts you to type the volume label. Then another message
 will appear, asking whether you want to format another disk. If you prefer,
 you can specify the volume label as an argument to format by using the
 option /v:label after the drive letter. For example, to give the label
 REPORTS to the disk in drive A, type the following:

 format a: /v:reports


 Since you have already specified the volume label, you will not be prompted
 to type it after the disk is formatted. Although a high-density
 (1.2-megabyte) drive is designed to format high-density disks, you can also
 format a 5-inch double-sided low-density (360K) disk by using the option /4.
 For example, to format a low-density disk in drive B, which is a
 high-density drive, type the following:

 format b: /4



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 This option is designed to format low-density disks that will be used in
 high-density drives. If you format a disk with the /4 option in a
 high-density (1.2-megabyte) drive, you might not be able to read that disk
 in a low-density (360K) drive.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 Formatting a 3-Inch Disk

 The format
 utility has two options that are used to format 3-inch disks: /t:tracks and
 /n:sectors. These options are normally used to format disks that are of a
 lower density than the drive (for example, to format a 720K disk in a
 1.44-megabyte drive).

 The /t:tracks option formats a disk to the number of tracks specified.
 Tracks is the number of tracks per disk. For 720K and 1.44-megabyte disks,
 this value is 80. If you do not specify this option, format uses the size of
 the drive to determine how many tracks the disk should have.

 The /n:sectors option formats a disk to the number of sectors specified.
 Sectors is the number of sectors per track. For 720K disks, this value is 9,
 and for 1.44-megabyte disks, this value is 18. For example, to format a
 3-inch low-density (720K) disk in drive A, which is a high-density drive,
 type the following:

 format a: /n:9


 You cannot do the opposite, however. You cannot format a high-density disk
 in a low-density drive.


 Copying a Disk

 To copy the contents of a floppy disk in one drive (the source
 drive) to a floppy disk in another drive (the destination drive), you can
 use the diskcopy utility. If the destination disk is unformatted, diskcopy
 formats the disk with the same number of sides and sectors per track as the
 source disk. Use this utility with care, since diskcopy destroys the
 existing contents of the destination disk. To run the diskcopy utility, you
 type diskcopy followed by the names of the source and destination drives.
 The source and destination drives can be the same; if you do not specify any
 drives, diskcopy uses the current drive as both source and destination. The
 diskcopy utility prompts you to insert the source and destination disks at
 appropriate times and waits for you to press a key before continuing. If
 errors are found on either disk, a message appears on the screen, describing
 the drive, track, and side where the error was found. After this, the
 copying operation continues. When it finishes copying the first disk,
 diskcopy asks you whether you want to copy another disk.

 The diskcopy utility is most often used to make backup copies of floppy
 disks. Diskcopy copies an entire floppy disk faster than the copy command
 does. For example, many applications require you to make backup copies of
 the installation disk. To do this using diskcopy, insert the installation
 disk in drive A, and a blank, formatted disk in drive B. Then type the
 following:

 diskcopy a: b:


 Or, if your computer has only one floppy-disk drive, specify drive A as both
 the source and the destination drive:

 diskcopy a: a:


 The diskcopy utility prompts you to insert the source or destination disk at
 appropriate times. When diskcopy has finished copying the disk, a message
 appears asking whether you want to copy another disk.

 The copying is done track by track and produces an identical copy of the
 original disk. Diskcopy does not work on hard disks, and you cannot run this
 utility on drives that you have used in the subst or join utility. Also,
 diskcopy ignores any assignments created by the assign utility, and the
 source and destination disks cannot be virtual or assigned disks. Certain
 restrictions apply concerning which types of disks can be copied in certain
 disk drives. For more information about types of disks and disk drives, see
 "Working with Disks," earlier in this chapter.


 Assigning or Changing the Volume Label

 To assign a volume label to a floppy disk or hard disk or to change the
 existing label, use the label utility. To use this utility, you type label
 followed by the drive letter and the label to be assigned to the disk. If
 you omit the drive letter, the label will be assigned to the current drive.
 For example, suppose that you want to change the volume label of drive D
 from APPS to MKTG. Type the following:

 label d:


 The current label is displayed, and you are prompted for the new volume
 label:

 The volume label in drive D is APPS.
 Enter a volume label of up to 11 characters
 or press Enter for no volume label update.


 Type mktg and press ENTER. If you now type vol d: to view the label, you
 will see that the label has been changed to MKTG. You can type the volume
 label on the command line, as follows:

 label d:mktg


 No messages are displayed. The prompt appears again after the operation is
 complete.


 Comparing Floppy Disks

 To compare the contents of a floppy disk in the source drive to the contents
 of a floppy disk in the destination drive, use the diskcomp utility. The
 comparison is done track by track, and diskcomp automatically determines the
 number of sides and sectors per track based on the format of the source
 disk. The source and destination disks must be of the same type. Diskcomp
 does not work on hard disks. For example, suppose that you receive an update
 package for a word-processing program. When you are in the middle of making
 a backup copy of the updated version, you are interrupted, and the floppy
 disk you have just copied gets mixed in with disks that contain old versions
 of the program. To determine which disk you just copied, place the update
 disk in drive A and one of the unknown disks in drive B, then type the
 following:

 diskcomp a: b:


 Or, if your computer has only one floppy-disk drive, specify drive A as both
 the source and destination drive:

 diskcomp a: a:


 The diskcomp utility prompts you to insert the source and destination disks
 at appropriate times during the disk comparison. If it finds a place where
 the contents of the two disks are not identical, an error message appears,
 telling you the side and track that are different.

 If the disks are identical, a message appears at the end of the comparison,
 telling you that the disks are identical. After diskcomp is through running,
 a message appears, asking you whether you want to compare two more disks.


 Working with Files and Directories

 MS OS/2 provides the following utilities to help you manage your
 files and directories:

 Utility                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 xcopy                             Copies a directory and its contents to
                                   another directory.

 tree                              Displays a list of all the directories
                                   and files on a drive.

 attrib                            Displays or sets the file flags (also
                                   known as attributes) of files.

 The following sections describe these utilities.


 Copying Directories and Subdirectories

 To copy an entire directory and its contents, use the xcopy utility. To use
 this utility, specify a source directory that files will be copied from and
 a destination where files will be placed. The source and destination can be
 a drive, directory path, and/or filename. If you do not specify a drive or
 directory path, xcopy uses the current drive and directory.

 The xcopy utility has several useful options. These options are described in
 the following sections.

 Specifying a Directory or Subdirectory

 You may want to copy not only the files in a directory, but all of the
 subdirectories as well. You could copy the files in each subdirectory
 individually to the destination directory, but this is often very time
 consuming. An easier way is to use the /s and /e options with xcopy. The /s
 option copies subdirectories unless they are empty; /e copies subdirectories
 that are empty. Together these options enable you to copy the files in the
 specified directory in addition to the files in all of the subdirectories.
 You must specify both options in order to copy all of the subdirectories.

 To see how these options work, suppose you have a directory named OS12,
 which has the following subdirectories and files:

              OS12
       ________|________________________________________
       |               |               |               |
      BIN            BATCH          FILE.DOC        FILE.BAK
       |         ______|______
       |         |           |
     MY.EXE    SHOW.CMD    TELL.CMD


 If you type the following, you will copy the files in the OS12 directory, as
 well as the files in the BIN and BATCH subdirectories, to the root directory
 in drive A:

 xcopy \os12\*.* /s /e a:\


 The xcopy utility preserves the original directory structure as it copies
 files and directoriesÄthe OS12 directory will appear in the root directory
 of drive A, BIN and BATCH will appear as subdirectories of OS12, and so on.

 Confirming Each Copying Operation

 The /p option causes the xcopy utility to prompt you with "(Y/N)?" after
 displaying the name of each source file and before copying it. To copy the
 file, type Y for yes. To prevent that file from being copied, type N for no.


 Verifying Each Copying Operation

 You can use the /v option to verify that each file is copied accurately.
 This compares the destination file to the source file to make sure that they
 are identical.

 Preserving Extended Attributes

 In MS OS/2, some applications attach extended attributes (additional
 information, such as author, application type, and file history) to your
 files and directories. These extended attributes are used by other
 applications, the file system, or the operating system itself. For example,
 an application such as Microsoft Excel may check a file's extended
 attributes to determine whether the file is a Microsoft Excel chart.

 The xcopy utility copies a source file's extended attributes to the
 destination file. You can see if your files have extended attributes by
 using the dir command with the /n option. If a file has extended attributes,
 the size of the attributes is displayed in the column before the filename.

 You may want to use the eautil utility before copying files that have
 extended attributes to a directory in MS-DOS or MS OS/2 versions earlier
 than 1.2. By using the eautil utility, you can split files and their
 extended attributes into separate files, copy the files, and then join the
 files together again. For information about the eautil utility, see the
 Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference.

 If you are copying a file that has extended attributes to a file system that
 does not support extended attributes, you may want to use the /f option with
 the xcopy utility. For more information about using the xcopy utility on
 files with extended attributes, see the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command
 Reference.


 Displaying the Directory Tree

 The tree utility displays the entire directory structure for a drive. To see
 the names of all the directories on your current drive (starting with the
 root directory), you type tree without arguments. To see the names of all
 the directories on a different drive, specify the name of the drive after
 tree.

 For example, to see the names of all the directories on drive B, type the
 following:

 tree b:


 A list similar to this one will appear:

 Directory path listing

 Path: \ACCOUNTS

 Subdirectories: APRIL
                  MAY



 Path: \ACCOUNTS\APRIL

 Subdirectories: None



 Path: \ACCOUNTS\MAY

 Subdirectories: None


 Since the directory-tree list may be very long, you will probably want to do
 one of two things when you use the tree utility. You may want to redirect
 the output to a file, or you may want to use the more utility to view the
 list one screenful at a time.

 Redirecting Output to a File

 Use the redirection symbol (>) to send the directory-tree list to a file.
 For example, to see the directories on your current drive and redirect them
 to the file TREE.LST, type the following:

 tree > tree.lst


 Then, you can use the type command to view the file TREE.LST or the print
 utility to print the file. The print utility is discussed in greater detail
 in "Printing Data Files," later in this chapter. .ET

 Viewing the Directory Tree One Screenful at a Time

 If you have many directories, the directory-tree list may scroll on your
 screen too fast for you to read. To view the list one screenful at a time,
 you can pipe the output of the tree utility to the more utility as follows:

 tree a: | more


 Each time a screenful of information is displayed, you will see the message
 "-- More --" displayed at the bottom of the screen. Press the SPACEBAR or
 the ENTER key to display the next screenful.

 Displaying Filenames

 You can use the /f option after the drive letter to display the names of the
 files within the directories on a drive. For example, suppose you want to
 generate a list of all the files that you currently have on your hard disk.
 To display a list of the directories and all of the files on drive C, type
 the following:

 tree c: /f





 Displaying and Setting File Flags


 You can use the attrib utility to display and set file flags, which are
 special features that a file can have. The following file flags can be set:
   ş   Read-only

   ş   Archive


 .RT You have the option of turning file flags on or off. If the read-only
 file flag is set, you can read a file but you cannot change its contents.
 This flag is commonly used to prevent a file from being deleted or changed
 accidentally. Flagging files with the archive flag allows you to copy only
 recently modified files to or from a disk with utilities such as backup,
 restore, and xcopy.



 Displaying File Flags

 To see which file flags are set for one or more files, you type attrib
 followed by the names of the files you are interested in. For example, to
 see which file flags are set on all of the files in your current directory,
 type the following:

 attrib *


 A file list appears on your screen, containing letters that signify which
 file flags are set for the file. The flags are followed by the drive,
 directory path, and filename. The file-flag letters you might see are as
 follows:

   ş   If the letter "R" appears, the read-only file flag is set for the
       file. This means that you can read the file, but you cannot change it.

   ş   If the letter "A" appears, the archive file flag is set for the file.
       By default setting, all files have the archive file flag set when they
       are created or modified. Certain programs, such as xcopy, backup, and
       restore, can turn off a file's archive file flag after they run. For
       more information about how the archive file flag works with these
       programs, see "Setting the Archive File Flag," later in this chapter.


 To gain a better understanding of how file flags work, suppose that a
 directory contains the files WORD.LST, ACCOUNTS.OLD, and LETTERyou type
 attrib *, the following appears on your screen:

       R  C:\WORD.LST
 A        C:\ACCOUNTS.OLD
 A     R  C:\LETTER


 Notice that WORD.LST and LETTERyou can read these files but you cannot
 change them. ACCOUNTS.OLD and LETTERarchive file flag turned off. To see the
 file flags for files in the current directory and in any subdirectories,
 type the /s option as follows:

 attrib * /s


 When you type this command, the subdirectory file entries are listed first
 and the current directory entries are listed last.

 Keep the following points in mind when you are copying files:

   ş   When you copy a file by using the copy command, the archive file flag
       is automatically set for the file you are copying to (the destination
       file). This is true even if the file being copied (the source file)
       has its archive file flag turned off.

   ş   If the source file has its read-only file flag set, this flag is not
       copied to the destination file.



 Setting the Read-Only File Flag


 The read-only file flag determines whether you can write to a file or a set
 of files. If the read-only flag is set, it prevents a file from being
 accidentally modified. Use the +r option to set the read-only file flag, and
 use the -r option to turn off the flag. Suppose, for example, that you have
 saved permanent personnel records in the database file EMPLOY.DBS. To
 prevent other users from modifying this file, set the read-only file flag by
 typing the following:
 attrib +r employ.dbs


 When other users type dir to get a directory list, the read-only file flag
 cannot be seen. However, if they try to use a text editor to modify the
 file, or if they try to delete the file, they will be prevented from
 performing the operation.

 If you later want to update the personnel records, turn off the read-only
 file flag by typing the following:

 attrib -r employ.dbs


 Now this file can be changed or deleted.

 Setting the Archive File Flag

 The archive file flag can be used as a control mechanism with the backup,
 restore, and xcopy utilities. Use the +a option to set the archive file
 flag, and use the -a option to turn it off.

 The /m option used with the backup and restore utilities copies only files
 that have their archive file flag set. The /m option then automatically
 turns off the archive file flag of the original files after copying them.
 Thus, if the archive file flag is turned off, the file is not backed up or
 restored.

 With the xcopy utility, you can choose to use the archive file flag in doing
 copying operations. If you use the /a option, only those files with their
 archive file flags set will be copied. If you choose the /m option, files
 with their archive file flags set are copied, and xcopy automatically turns
 off the archive file flags of the original files after copying them. You
 usually will not need to turn a file's archive file flag on or off. However,
 there may be times when you want to modify the way that the backup, restore,
 or xcopy utilities operate on certain files. For example, suppose that each
 Monday you make a backup disk that contains specific directories by using
 the backup utility with the /m option. To save time, you decide to copy only
 essential files to the backup disk. Instead of letting backup find and copy
 all of the files that have their file flags set, you can use the -a option
 to turn off the file flags for all of the files that have the extension
 .BAK. To perform this operation, type the following:

 attrib -a *.bak


 This means that the files that have the extension .BAK will not be copied
 when you use backup to perform the copying operation.

 For more information about the backup and restore utilities, see Chapter 12,
 "Maintaining Your System."


 Working with Data Files


 MS OS/2 provides the following utilities to help you view and work with data
 files:
 Utility                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 more                              Displays output from a command or
                                   utility, one screenful at a time.

 sort                              Sorts a file alphabetically or
                                   numerically.

 find                              Finds a text string in a file.

 comp                              Compares two files or sets of files.

 The more and sort utilities (sometimes called filter commands) take input
 from a device or file, process the input, and then send it to an output
 device or file. As such, they are used in conjunction with redirection
 symbols or pipes. The more and sort utilities must be run from the MS OS/2
 command interpreter (cmd)Äthey cannot be run from Desktop Manager. For more
 information on redirection symbols or pipes, see Chapter 8, "Running Cmd."


 Displaying Output One Screenful at a Time

 To display output one screenful at a time, use the more utility. You can use
 this utility in two ways:

   ş   To view the output of a command or utility one screenful at a time

   ş   To view files one screenful at a time


 You can either redirect an input file or pipe the output of a command or
 utility to more. When the first screen is filled, the message "-- More --"
 appears at the bottom of the screen. Press the ENTER key to display the next
 screenful of information.
 To view the output of a command or utility one screenful at a time, redirect
 the output to the more utility. To do this, you use the pipe (|) symbol.
 For example, a long directory list often contains more filenames than can
 appear in a single screen. You can use the more utility to display your
 directory list one screenful at a time by typing the following:

 dir | more


 Other commands and utilities, such as type, display output information that
 can also be piped to the more utility. For example, suppose that you have a
 long file, CLIENTS.NEW, that you want to view on your screen. The following
 command pipes the file to more:

 type clients.new | more


 When you type this command, the CLIENTS.NEW file is displayed one screenful
 at a time. You could accomplish the same thing by redirecting a file as
 input to the screen, one screenful at a time. To do this, type the

 Sorting Input and Output

 To sort input or output according to the character found in a specified
 column, use the sort utility. Most often you would want to sort by the
 character in the first columnÄfor example, by the first character of the
 first word on each lineÄbut you can sort by any column you want. The
 character is sorted based upon its location in the character set you are
 using. Which character set you are using depends upon the code page that is
 set up for your system. (See the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command
 Reference for the character sets of the different code pages.) .ET

 For the United States character set, the characters are sorted from 0 to 9
 and then from A to Z. The sort utility does not distinguish between
 uppercase and lowercase letters. You can sort files of up to 64K in length.

 You can use the sort utility in two ways:

   ş   To sort a file that has been sent as input to sort

   ş   To sort the output of another command or utility



 Sorting a File

 To sort the lines in a file, you redirect an input file to sort. Each line
 in the file is sorted based upon the character found in the first column,
 unless you specify a column number. (For more information on how to specify
 a column number to be used for sorting, see "Sorting by Column," later in
 this chapter.) For example, suppose that the file INFILE.LST contains the
 following list of customer names:

 Draper, John
 Benson, Clara
 Wiggins, Bess
 Peters, Marcus


 To sort the contents of the INFILE.LST file, type the following:

 sort < infile.lst


 The list is then sorted and displayed in this way:

 Benson, Clara
 Draper, John
 Peters, Marcus
 Wiggins, Bess



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 The sort utility does not permanently change the order of the contents in
 the original file. For more information about saving the sorted output in
 another file, see Chapter 8, "Running Cmd."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 .RT If you want to reverse the order so that the file is sorted from Z to A
 or from 9 to 0, you can use the /r option. For example, if you use this
 option with INFILE.LST, your sorted file will look like this:

 Wiggins, Bess
 Peters, Marcus
 Draper, John
 Benson, Clara




 Sorting Output

 You can also pipe the output from another command or utility to the sort
 utility. For example, to sort the directory list for your current directory,
 type the following:

 dir | sort


 You will see your directory list displayed in alphabetical order.

      6 File(s)   841728 bytes free
  Directory of C:\CLUB
  The volume label in drive C is APPS.
  The Volume Serial Number is A512:6414

 .       <DIR>           3-25-89   3:37p
 ..      <DIR>           3-25-89   3:37p
 ACCOUNT  OLD       92   6-25-89   5:52p
 CAT      TXT      120   4-16-89   8:26a
 LETTER   FIL      252   3-20-89   4:10p
 WORD     LST       56   5-10-89  11:16a




 Sorting by Column

 You can specify any column to be used for the sorting. The option /+n sorts
 according to the character in column n. For example, to sort your directory
 list according to the date it was created or last modified, you could sort
 according to the date field. Let's say that your date field starts in column
 22 of the directory list. To sort by the date field, type the following:

 dir | sort /+


 Your directory list will now appear like this:

  Directory of C:\CLUB
 LETTER   FIL      252   3-20-89   4:10p
 .       <DIR>           3-25-89   3:37p
 ..      <DIR>           3-25-89   3:37p
 CAT      TXT      120   4-16-89   8:26a
 WORD     LST       56   5-10-89  11:16a
 ACCOUNT  OLD       92   6-25-89   5:52p
      6 File(s)   841728 bytes free
  The volume label in drive C is APPS.
  The Volume Serial Number is A512:6414





 Searching for a String in a File

 To search for a string in a file, use the find
 utility. If find locates the string it is searching for, it displays the
 name of the file followed by the line that contains the string. To use the
 find utility, you type find followed by any options, the string you are
 searching for (in quotation marks), and the name of the file to search. You
 cannot use wildcard characters (* or ?) in a filename specification, and
 because the find utility is case-sensitive, you must type the string with
 the exact uppercase and lowercase characters that you want to search for. If
 you do not specify a filename for the search, standard input is usedÄthis
 means that, unless input has been redirected from a file or from the output
 of another program, the find utility reads input from the keyboard. (You
 terminate keyboard input by pressing CTRL+Z or F6 and then pressing ENTER.)

 For example, to search for the last name "Smith" in the PHONE.LST file, type
 the following:

 find "  phone.lst


 If you are searching for a string that contains quotation marks (for
 example, "Hi there!" or I said "Hi there!" to Ralph), you must substitute
 two sets of quotation marks for the single set of quotation marks, as in the
 following examples:

 find "    there!"   test.doc


 Or

 find "  said "   there!"  to Ralph" test.doc


 Although you cannot use wildcard characters to specify filenames to be
 searched, you can pipe another command to the find utility. For example, if
 you want to search the files PHONE.MKT, PHONE.ENG, and PHONE.SUP for the
 name "Smith", pipe the output of the type command to the find utility as
 follows:

 type phone.* | find "


 This way, the find utility searches through three files instead of one. You
 can also specify more than one file to search by listing each file
 separately after the search string.

 Displaying Lines That Do Not Contain a String

 If you want to search a file and display those lines that do not contain the
 specified string, use the /v option. For example, suppose that you are
 searching for client names that are listed in the file CLIENTS.LST. To
 locate the client names that do not have the string "Past Due" after their
 names, type the following:

 find /v "Past Due" clients.lst




 Displaying the Count of Lines That Contain a String

 To display the count of lines that contain the specified string, use the /c
 option. For example, you could find the count of lines that contain the
 string "Past Due" by typing the following:

 find /c "Past Due" clients.lst


 If you specify /c with /v, the find utility displays the count of lines that
 do not contain the string you typed.

 Displaying the Line Number

 To display the line number of any lines that contain a specified string, use
 the /n option. The /n option causes each line to be preceded by its line
 number in the file.

 If you specify /c with /n, the find utility ignores /n.


 Comparing Two Files

 To compare one file or set of files with a second file or set of files, use
 the comp utility. The files can be on different drives or in different
 directories. To use the comp utility, you type comp followed by the drive,
 directory path, and filename of both files. If you do not specify a
 directory path or filename, comp assumes that the files are in the current
 directory on the current drive.

 You can use the comp utility in several ways.

 To compare the contents of drive A with drive C, type the following:

 comp a: c:


 To compare the contents of the PROFITS directory on drive A and the PROF
 directory on drive C, type the following:

 comp a:\eprofits c:\eprof


 To compare the contents of two files, \1988\SAMPLE.C and \1989\SAMPLE.C, in
 different directories, type the following:

 comp c:\1988\sample.c c:\1989\sample.c


 To compare the files in the root directory on drive C that have the
 extension .ASM with the files in the root directory on drive B that have the
 extension .BAK, type the following:

 comp c:\*.asm b:\*.bak


 If the files being compared are of different sizes, comp displays a message
 telling you of their size differences and then asks you if you want to
 continue. If you type Y for yes, comp displays the location and contents of
 any mismatched bytes. After 10 mismatches occur, the comparison stops and
 you are asked whether you want to compare two more files. An error message
 appears if comp does not find an endof-file (CTRL+Z) marker in a file.


 Printing Data Files

 To print any MS OS/2 data file, you can use the print utility. To use the
 print utility, you type print followed by a filename. By default setting,
 print sends the file to the printer that is attached to your computer's LPT1
 port. If you want to send the file to a printer that is attached to another
 port, use the option /d:device. For example, to print the file
 REPORTparallel printer that is attached to LPT2, type the following:

 print /d:lpt2 report


 Remember that LPT2 and the printer that is attached to it must be set up
 correctly before you can print to it.

 The print utility can be used by itself or in conjunction with the print
 spooler, Print Manager. For instructions on how to set up and use the Print
 Manager, see Chapter 4, "Printing Files."


 Selecting the Keyboard Layout

 To select an alternative keyboard layout, use the keyb utility. The keyboard
 layout defines where the characters in a specified code page will be found
 on your keyboard.

 If you have selected and prepared a code page for a country other than the
 United States, your keyboard layout will be set up for that country. To
 change to a keyboard layout for a different country, you must use the keyb
 utility. To use the keyb utility, you type keyb followed by a two-letter
 country code. For example, to select the keyboard layout for Germany, type
 the following:

 keyb gr


 Make sure that the keyboard country code you select is supported by the code
 page that is installed. The following list shows the keyboard layouts that
 are available and the two-letter codes that identify them:

 The subcode specifies a keyboard layout for countries that have more than
 one keyboard layout. Subcodes are associated with enhanced keyboards only.
 Because France, Italy, and the United Kingdom have more than one enhanced
 keyboard, the subcode allows you to select the keyboard you want.


 Turning ANSI Support On or Off

 The ansi utility turns the ANSI extended screen and keyboard support on or
 off. If ANSI support is turned on, a program that you are using (or
 creating) can use the ANSI escape sequences. An ANSI escape sequence is a
 series of characters (beginning with an escape character or keystroke) that
 you can use to define MS OS/2 functions. For more information about ANSI
 escape sequences, see Chapter 17, "Using MS OS/2 Device Drivers," and
 Appendix A, "ANSI Escape Sequences." By default setting, ANSI support is on.
 To turn ANSI support off, type the following:

 ansi off


 To turn ANSI support back on, type the following:

 ansi on


 To turn ANSI support on in the DOS session, install the device driver
 ANSI.SYS by including the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\ansi.sys


 For more information about ANSI.SYS, see Chapter 17, "Using MS OS/2 Device
 Drivers."






 Chapter 10  Using the DOS Session
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ






 In addition to the full-screen session and the Presentation Manager session,
 MS OS/2 provides another working environment, called the DOS session.

 If you are familiar with DOS and DOS applications, you will find that the
 DOS session operates much the way the DOS operating system does. As the name
 implies, the DOS session is like having the DOS operating system installed
 and running on your computer. You can use files, disk drives, printers, and
 serial devices just as if you were running DOS, as well as run DOS
 applications, such as Microsoft Works or Microsoft Windows. In addition,
 many of the MS OS/2 commands and utilities described in Chapter 8, "Running
 Cmd," and Chapter 9, "Using MS OS/2 Utilities," can be run in the DOS
 session.

 Since DOS uses the FAT file system exclusively, programs written for DOS may
 encounter problems when they attempt to access files and directories that
 use HPFS naming rules. DOS programs generally will not recognize these names
 and will be unable to access the files. For details on how HPFS files and
 directories work with DOS, see Chapter 16, "Using the High-Performance File
 System."

 When you are running programs in the DOS session, a command interpreter
 called command provides the interface to MS OS/2. Command reads information
 that you type at the command prompt and translates it into something your
 computer can use.

 This chapter describes the DOS session and command. Specifically, it
 describes how the DOS session starts up and is initialized, as well as how
 to do the following:

   ş   Switch to the DOS session

   ş   Start DOS programs

   ş   Run commands from command

   ş   Run utilities from command


 You will also find lists of the MS OS/2 commands and utilities that can and
 cannot be run in the DOS session.


 How the DOS Session Starts

 Whenever you start MS OS/2, it reads the CONFIG.SYS file. This file contains
 statements that set up the DOS, full-screen, and Presentation Manager
 sessions. To start the DOS session, MS OS/2 runs the DOS command-interpreter
 program that is specified by the shell configuration command. By the default
 setting, the command interpreter is command. Other configuration commands in
 CONFIG.SYS customize the DOS environment; these are listed in the following
 section. After the DOS session starts, you will see it represented by the
 DOS icon in the Presentation Manager session.


 Configuring the DOS Environment

 During installation, a default DOS environment is set up for you. You can
 modify this environment by editing your CONFIG.SYS file. The following
 configuration commands affect the DOS environment:

 Command                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 shell                             Specifies the DOS command interpreter.

 rmsize                            Sets up the amount of memory reserved
                                   for DOS programs.

 break                             Sets up CTRL+C checking.

 fcbs                              Specifies the number of open
                                   file-control blocks.

 device                            Sets up devices used in the DOS session.

 protectonly                       Enables or disables the DOS session.

 For more information about using these configuration commands, see Chapter
 15, "Using MS OS/2 Configuration Commands." Also see "Using a Mouse in the
 DOS Session," later in this chapter, for information about setting up a
 mouse for the DOS session.


 Running AUTOEXEC.BAT


 The first time you switch
 o the DOS session, command, the DOS command interpreter, automatically
 searches for a batch file called AUTOEXEC.BAT in the root directory of the
 drive from which you started MS OS/2. (Note that batch files run in the DOS
 session must have the filename extension .BAT, not the .CMD extension that
 batch files run under the MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd, must have.) If
 it does not find the AUTOEXEC.BAT batch file, MS OS/2 runs the date and time
 commands. If AUTOEXEC.BAT is found, it starts to run.
 By placing batch commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you can run commands
 and utilities, and you can customize the DOS session. Like other batch files
 in the DOS session, AUTOEXEC.BAT can contain the following:

   ş   Command commands

   ş   MS OS/2 utilities

   ş   Batch commands


 .ET Typically, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file sets up environment variables and other
 features. For example, you can specify a search path for the DOS command
 interpreter, command, by using set path= in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. You can
 also add commands to AUTOEXEC.BAT in order to perform specialized functions.


 In the following example, the AUTOEXEC.BAT batch file makes your command
 prompt the name of the current directory followed by the greater-than sign
 (>). It then sets your path, instructing command to search the current
 directory first, the BIN directory on drive C second, and the OS2 directory
 on drive C third. Finally, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file switches you to the OS2
 directory on your C drive.

 @echo off
 prompt = $p$g
 set path=c:\bin;c:\os2
 c:
 cd \os2


 The @echo off command at the beginning of the file prevents the commands
 from being displayed on the screen as they run.


 Switching to the DOS Session

 Whenever you start MS OS/2, the DOS session is automatically started for
 you. To work in the DOS session, you must switch to it. The following are
 two ways to switch to the DOS session from Presentation Manager:

       Mouse 

   ş   If you are using a mouse, double-click the DOS icon.


 Or

       Keyboard 

   ş   If you are using the keyboard, use the Task List.


 .RT For information on using the Task List and switching between sessions,
 see Chapter 2, "Running Applications with MS OS/2."

 After you switch to the DOS session, the screen clears and the DOS command
 interpreter, command, displays a prompt. From this prompt, you can start
 programs, commands, or utilities.


 Switching from the DOS Session

 Once the DOS session is started, you cannot quit it. The command program
 started by the system will continue to run, even if you type exit. To run a
 program in a full-screen or Presentation Manager session, you must switch
 out of the DOS session. To switch out of the DOS session, you can do one of
 the following:

   ş   Press ALT+ESC to switch to another session.


 Or

   ş   Press CTRL+ESC to use the Task List.


 When you switch out of the DOS session, any DOS programs that are running
 will stop until you switch back to the DOS session. However, full-screen or
 Presentation Manager programs that are running will continue to run when you
 are in the DOS session.


 Starting a DOS Program

 To start a program from the DOS command interpreter, command, you type the
 name of the program at the prompt and press ENTER.

 Remember that not all programs can run in the DOS session. For example,
 Presentation Manager applications and many full-screen OS/2 programs cannot
 run in the DOS session. If you try to run a Presentation Manager application
 in the DOS session, you will receive the following message:

 This program requires OS/2 Presentation Manager.


 Or, if you try to run an application that is meant to run from the MS OS/2
 command interpreter, cmd, you will receive this message:

 This program cannot be run in DOS mode.


 In either case, switch to the appropriate session before running your
 program.

 You can also add a DOS application to a group window in Desktop Manager and
 start the application from there. For information about adding an
 application to Desktop Manager, see Chapter 2, "Running Applications with MS
 OS/2."

 Also, while the DOS session operates much like the DOS operating system,
 compatibility problems can exist with some DOS applications that are run in
 the DOS session. Read your application's manual for information about which
 MS OS/2 environment is required to run the program.


 Managing Memory in the DOS Session

 Certain DOS-application manuals may recommend
 that you install a disk cache or virtual disk to improve performance. If you
 plan to run these applications in the DOS session under MS OS/2, keep the
 following points in mind:

   ş   The disk-cache program, SMARTDrive, is not supported in MS OS/2. To
       set up disk caching, use the diskcache configuration command in your
       CONFIG.SYS file.

   ş   The virtual-disk program, RAM disk, is not supported in MS OS/2. To
       set up a virtual disk, use the device configuration command in your
       CONFIG.SYS file to load the VDISK.SYS device driver.


 For information on setting up the MS OS/2 disk cache, see Chapter 15, "Using
 MS OS/2 Configuration Commands." For information on installing the VDISK.SYS
 device driver, see Chapter 17, "Using MS OS/2 Device Drivers."

 Also read your application's manual for additional information concerning
 memory management with MS OS/2.


 Setting Hardware Features in the DOS Session

 The DOS session runs
 independently of the full-screen and Presentation Manager sessions. Features
 such as hardware settings made with the mode utility are in effect only
 while you are running the DOS session. If you switch to a full-screen
 session or to Presentation Manager, the DOS settings will not be in effect.


 Using a Mouse in the DOS Session

 If you want to use a mouse in the DOS session, make sure that you have
 specified the proper mouse driver in your CONFIG.SYS file. In addition, some
 applications require you to specify an additional device driver called
 EGA.SYS. For instructions on how to specify these device drivers in the
 CONFIG.SYS file, see Chapter 17, "Using MS OS/2 Device Drivers."


 Running DOS TSR Programs

 Terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs that are designed to run in DOS
 (for example, thOS/2. Once started, these programs remain active while you ar
 session, but they become inactive when you switch to a full-screen session
 or to Presentation Manager. These programs can occupy a large amount of
 memory, and compatibility problems can exist if they are run in the DOS
 session. Be sure to read your program's manual for instructions and
 restrictions concerning MS OS/2.



 Using a DOS Command

 The DOS command interpreter, command, like the cmd program, has a set of
 built-in commands. These commands let you work with files, directories, and
 devices. The following is a list of the commands you can use in the DOS
 session:

 break   chcp  chdir  cls
 copy    date  dir    exit
 set     time  type   ver
 verify  vol   del    (erase)
 mkdir   (md)  path   prompt
 rename  ren)  rmdir  (rd)

 Most of these commands are identical to those found in cmd and are described
 in Chapter 8, "Running Cmd." Certain commands, however, may display slightly
 different on-screen messages when they run in the DOS session. And, when you
 run them from command, the following commands do not accept multiple drives
 or filenames:

 del   (erase)
 dir
 mkdir (md)
 rmdir (rd)
 type
 vol


 The break command is the only command found in the DOS command interpreter,
 command, that is not found in the MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd. For a
 description of the break command, see the following section, "Setting CTRL+C
 Checking."


 Setting CTRL+C Checking

 The break command lets you set CTRL+C checking. Normally, MS OS/2 checks to
 see whether you have pressed CTRL+C only while it is reading from your
 keyboard or while it is sending something to your screen or printer. You can
 use the break command to turn CTRL+C checking on or off. If the break
 command is turned on, CTRL+C checking is turned on while the system performs
 additional functions, such as disk reading and writing. (By default setting,
 CTRL+C checking is turned off.) To find out what the current setting is for
 the break command, type the following:

    break

 To turn CTRL+C checking on, type the following:

    break on

 To turn CTRL+C checking off, type the following:

    break off

 Some programs may internally set CTRL+C checking. The break command does not
 affect these programs.

 You can also set CTRL+C checking by placing a break configuration command in
 your CONFIG.SYS file. For more information about setting CTRL+C checking,
 see Chapter 15, "Using MS OS/2 Configuration Commands."


 Running a Utility in the DOS Session

 Most of the utilities that you can run in the MS OS/2 command interpreter,
 cmd, you can also run in the command program. The following utilities run
 in both cmd and command:

 attrib  chkdsk  comp      diskcomp
 help    label   replace   sort
 tree    unpack  diskcopy  find
 format  mode    more      xcopy
 patch   print   recover

 These utilities are described in Chapter 9, "Using MS OS/2 Utilities," and
 Chapter 12, "Maintaining Your System." Certain on-screen messages may differ
 slightly if a utility is run in the DOS session; this does not affect the
 utility's usage or function. The patch, replace, and unpack utilities are
 described in the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 You can run the print and mode utilities in the DOS session and in a
 full-screen session. However, the way you run the commands differs between
 the two sessions. For more information, see the Microsoft Operating System/2
 Command Reference.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 The following utilities can be run only in the DOS session and are described
 in the following sections:

 append
 assign
 graftabl
 join
 setcom40
 subst





 Reassigning Paths and Drives

 To change how MS OS/2 accesses data and drives, you can use the append,
 assign, join, and subst utilities. For example, certain applications may
 require that you set the data path, much the same as you set the PATH
 environment variable. Or, you might want to change drive or directory-path
 assignments to make working with a particular drive or directory path
 easier.

 Setting a Data Search Path

 To set a data search path in the DOS session, use the append utility. Unless
 you specify a particular directory path on a command line, MS OS/2 searches
 only your current directory for data files. With the append utility, you can
 specify the additional directories to be searched for data files. MS OS/2
 will first search the current directory for a data file, then search the
 directories that you have specified with the append utility. This can be
 useful if you have data files located in different directories or located
 across a network. Using the append utility to set a data search path and
 store it in the environment requires two steps. First, type the following:

 append /e


 The /e option can be used only the first time you use the append utility.
 This option stores append as an environment variable. If you do not want to
 store append in the environment, omit this step.

 Second, type append followed by the directory paths that you want to add to
 the data search path. For example, to use the TEST directory on drive A and
 the SAMPLE directory on drive C as the data path, type the following:

 append a:\test;c:\sample


 You use a semicolon (;) to separate individual directories. The append
 command must not contain more than 128 characters.

 To display the data search path, you type append by itself. In the preceding
 example, if you type append, the following will appear on your screen:

 APPEND=A:\eTEST;C:\SAMPLE


 When you want to restore the data path to the default setting (which
 searches only the current directory for data files), type the following:

 append;


 To see how append might be used, suppose that you have customerinformation
 files stored in the directories CUST1 and CUST2 on drive C, and in the
 directory CUST3 on a floppy disk in drive A. You could set up your data
 search path by typing the following:

 append /e
 append c:\cust1;c:\cust2;a:\cust3


 Now, if you want to display the contents of the SMITH.ACC file, which is in
 one of these three directories, type the following:

 more < smith.acc


 MS OS/2 searches the current directory for the file SMITH.ACC. If it doesn't
 find the file, MS OS/2 searches the CUST1, CUST2, and CUST3 directories in
 the order they are listed. If MS OS/2 finds the file in any of those
 directories, it displays the contents of the file one screenful at a time.

 Assigning a Drive Letter to Another Drive

 To assign a drive letter
 to another drive, you can use the assign utility. Some applications require
 that you put your disks in a floppy-disk drive. If you prefer to use a hard
 disk for your data files, you can use the assign utility to assign the
 floppy-disk drive letter to the hard-disk drive. So instead of reading from
 and writing to the floppy-disk drive, such as drive A, you can assign drive
 A to drive C. Then, when you request drive A, you will actually get drive C.
 To use the assign utility, you type assign followed by the drive letter you
 want to reassign and the letter of the drive you want to assign the first
 drive to. Separate the two drive letters with an equal sign (=). For
 example, to assign drive A to drive C, type the following:

 assign a=c


 Now, if you type dir a:, you will actually see a directory list for the
 current directory on drive C. To reset all drives to their original
 assignments, type the following:

 assign



 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you plan to use both the assign utility and the append utility, you must
 first set the data path by using the append utility. You could do this, for
 example, by including an append statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 Since the assign utility disguises the true device type, you should not use
 assign with commands and utilities that require drive information, such as
 label, join, subst, and print.

 The format, diskcopy, and diskcomp utilities ignore drive reassignments.

 Joining a Drive to a Directory Path

 To give a drive the name of a directory on
 your current drive, use the join utility. Once you have done this, you no
 longer access files and directories on the "joined" physical drive with a
 separate drive letter. You use only the directory name to access that drive
 now joined to the directory.

 To use this utility, you type join followed by a drive letter and the path
 of the directory that will be associated with that drive. The drive letter
 you specify must already exist. You cannot join a drive if it is being used
 by another program. For example, if you want to refer to drive D as the DATA
 directory on drive C, type the following:

 join d: c:\data


 If the directory does not exist, MS OS/2 creates it. The directory you
 specify must be empty, and it must be a subdirectory, not the root
 directory.

 Now, if you type dir c:\data, you will see the contents of the root
 directory on drive D. You can also type join without arguments to see the
 drives and directories that are currently joined. To disable the connection
 between drive D and the DATA directory, use the /d option, as follows:

 join d: /d


 The following utilities do not work on drives used in the join utility:

 chkdsk
 diskcomp
 diskcopy
 format
 label
 recover


 Keep in mind that once you have used the join command to join a drive, MS
 OS/2 will display an error message if you try to use that drive letter. You
 must restore the drive by using the /d option before you can refer to the
 drive again.

 Substituting a Drive Letter for a Path

 You can
 substitute a drive letter for a directory path with the subst utility. After
 you have substituted a drive letter for a directory path, you can refer to
 the substituted drive just like a physical drive. When you request the
 substituted drive, MS OS/2 will replace it with the directory path you have
 assigned to it. To see what substituted drives are currently in effect, you
 type subst without options. To set up a new substituted drive, you type
 subst followed by the drive letter and then the directory path that the
 drive letter will substitute.

 For example, to substitute drive Z for the directory path \ACCOUNTS\PAYABLE
 on drive C, type the following:

 subst z: c:\accounts\epayable


 Now, if you type dir z:, you will see the contents of the PAYABLE
 subdirectory of the ACCOUNTS directory on drive C. To delete a drive
 substitution, use the /d option, as follows:

 subst z: /d


 The following commands do not work on drives created by the subst utility:

 chkdsk
 diskcompdiskcopy
 format
 label
 recover





 Displaying Disk Status from the DOS Session

 The chkdsk utility displays status information about a disk and scans it for
 errors. You can run chkdsk from either cmd or command. While the command
 form you use to start the utility is the same for both, you receive
 additional information about the DOS session if you run chkdsk from command.


 In addition to disk-status information, you receive DOS storage information,
 as in the following example:

 [DOS mode storage report]
    655328 bytes total storage
    535024 bytes free


 The "bytes free" line tells you the amount of available memory in the DOS
 session to run other applications. The "bytes total storage" line tells you
 how much memory is reserved for the DOS session. With the default setting,
 640 kilobytes are reserved. You can change the amount that is reserved by
 using the rmsize configuration command. For more information about setting
 the amount of memory for DOS applications, see Chapter 15, "Using MS OS/2
 Configuration Commands."


 Enabling an Extended Character Set

 To load an extended character set in the DOS session, when your computer's
 graphics adapter is operating in graphics mode, use the graftabl utility. To
 load an extended character set, you type graftabl followed by a three-digit
 number that identifies a code page. You can specify any one of the following
 code pages:

 Code page                         Extended character set
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 437                               United States (default setting)

 850                               Multilingual

 860                               Portuguese

 863                               Canadian French

 For example, to load the Canadian French extended character set, type the
 following:

 graftabl 863


 To display the current extended character set, along with a list of graftabl
 options, type the following:

 graftabl ?


 To display the current extended character set, type the following:

 graftabl /status


 To display the current extended character set and load the default extended
 character set (code page 437), type the following:

 graftabl


 For more information about setting up code pages, see Chapter 15, "Using MS
 OS/2 Configuration Commands."


 Setting COM-Port Availability

 To make a serial port available to a DOS program, use the
 setcom40 utility.

 Some DOS applications use a particular area in memory to determine the
 presence of the serial ports COM1 and COM2. The COM01.SYS or COM02.SYS
 device driver places zeros in these locations to prevent DOS-session
 programs from using these ports.

 You should use the setcom40 utility if you have used the device
 configuration command to install COM01.SYS or COM02.SYS (or an equivalent
 device driver). The setcom40 utility sets the appropriate address for the
 serial port before starting a program in the DOS session that uses the port.
 To use this utility, you type setcom40 followed by the name of the serial
 port you want to use, then specify whether you want to turn serial-port
 availability on or off. For example, suppose you have a serial printer
 attached to COM1 and have installed COM01.SYS. If you want to use a
 DOS-session program to print a file using that printer, type the following:

 setcom40 com1=on


 Suppose you also want to add an extra terminal to COM2. To do this, type the
 following:

 setcom40 com2=on


 Now, both COM1 and COM2 can be used by DOS programs.

 When you no longer need to use the printer, type the following:

 setcom40 com1=off


 When using serial ports in the DOS session, keep the following points in
 mind:

   ş   The setcom40 utility does not affect settings made with the mode
       utility.

   ş   Programs that are running in the DOS session should not use serial
       ports that are being used in a full-screen or Presentation Manager
       session, or serial ports that are being used by Print Manager.

   ş   If a program is using serial ports in the DOS session, it is important
       to end the program before switching out of the DOS session.

   ş   Two types of DOS-session programs may have problems using serial
       portsÄthose that use intermittent hardware interrupts and those that
       are time-dependent. In addition, some BASIC programs will interfere
       with the port even when they are not sending input to it or receiving
       output from it.


 For more information about COM0x.SYS device drivers, see Chapter 17, "Using
 MS OS/2 Device Drivers."

 Introduction

 Once you know how to run MS OS/2 commands, you can create your own programs
 to carry out complex or specialized tasks. With MS OS/2, you can combine
 commands and programs into a single program called a batch program or batch
 file.

 With batch programs, you can do the following:

   ş   Run several commands from one batch program

   ş   Carry out the same batch program with different data


 You can use batch programs to simplify a series of repetitive tasks, thus
 reducing the amount of typing you need to do. Or you can create custom
 commands designed for your particular work needs. You might, for example,
 need to copy different directories on a regular basis from your hard disk to
 a backup floppy disk. Instead of copying each directory separately by typing
 five copy commands at the prompt, you could type the name of the batch
 program once and let it do the five copying operations for you.

 A batch program consists of one or more lines of instructions that the
 command interpreter (cmd or command) reads and processes one at a time. As
 each line is processed, it is displayed (echoed) on your screen. (Later in
 this chapter you will learn how to prevent each line from being echoed.)

 The first sections of this chapter demonstrate how to build a simple batch
 program to perform a series of tasks. In later sections, you will learn how
 to improve and enhance this program with advanced batch-programming
 techniques.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 All examples of file and directory names in this chapter are for the file
 allocation table (FAT) file system, which is the one used by DOS and MS OS/2
 versions 1.1 and earlier. If your batch files contain file or directory
 names that use high-performance file system (HPFS) naming features, you must
 enclose those names in quotation marks. For more information on using (HPFS)
 file and directory names, see Chapter 16, "Using the High-Performance File
 System."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Running a Batch Program

 To run your program, you type the name of your batch file, without the
 extension, then press ENTER. For example, if your batch file is named
 SPECIAL.CMD, type special in an OS/2 session to run the batch program. If
 the batch file is named SPECIAL.BAT, type special in the DOS session. If you
 want to stop your program before it finishes running, press CTRL+C.


 Using Batch Commands

 There are two types of batch programs: those that are run from an OS/2
 session and those that are run from the DOS session. Batch programs that are
 run from an OS/2 session have a .CMD filename extension. These programs can
 contain MS OS/2 batch commands, cmd commands, MS OS/2 utilities, and
 programs that can be run from the MS OS/2 command interpreter, cmd. Batch
 programs that are run from the DOS session have a .BAT filename extension.
 These programs can contain MS OS/2 batch commands, command commands, MS OS/2
 utilities, and programs that can be run from the DOS command interpreter,
 command.

 Batch commands give you control over how your commands are carried out. They
 also let you send or display messages, set variables, and use replaceable
 parameters (described later in this chapter).

 The MS OS/2 batch commands are as follows:

 Command                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 call                              Calls one batch program from another
                                   batch program.

 echo                              Turns the echo feature on or off.

 endlocal                          Restores the drive, directory, and
                                   environment settings that were in effect
                                   before the setlocal command was used.

 extproc                           Defines an external batch processor for
                                   a batch program.

 for                               Performs a command for a set of items.

 goto                              Causes processing to continue at the
                                   line after a specified label.



 Command                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 if                                Performs a command based on the result
                                   of a condition.

 pause                             Suspends processing of the batch program
                                   temporarily.

 rem                               Adds remarks to a batch program.

 setlocal                          Defines drive, directory, and
                                   environment variables that are used
                                   during batch-program processing.

 shift                             Changes the position of the replaceable
                                   parameters in batch-program processing.

 The endlocal, extproc, and setlocal commands can be used only in an OS/2
 session; the rest of the batch commands can be used in OS/2 sessions and in
 the DOS session. The echo and for commands can be typed at the command
 prompt as well as be placed in batch programs; all other batch commands can
 be used only in batch programs.


 Creating Simple Batch Programs

 You create a batch program by typing commands in a file by using System
 Editor or any other text editor. Batch programs that you run from cmd, the
 MS OS/2 command interpreter, must have the filename extension .CMD. Batch
 programs in the DOS session must have the .BAT filename extension. Most of
 the filename examples used in this chapter have the .CMD extension. However,
 if you rename the files so that they have the .BAT extension, the sample
 batch programs will run in the DOS session. You run a batch program by
 typing the name of the batch file. (You do not need to type the extension.)

 The examples in this discussion have been simplified as much as possible to
 illustrate batch-programming commands and techniques. When you write a
 working batch program, however, you will probably want to embellish it with
 commands that provide error checking and commands that provide helpful
 information for the user.

 The simplest batch programs usually run utilities and display messages on
 the screen. They perform the same function that you would perform if you
 typed a series of commands at the command prompt.

 For example, the following is a simple batch program called Myprompt, stored
 in the batch file MYPROMPT.CMD:

 @echo off
 rem This is a simple batch program
 prompt The current time is $t$h$h$h$h$h$h$_$p


 This program changes your prompt so that it displays the time, the current
 drive, and the directory. (The $h characters remove the seconds and
 hundredths of seconds from the time display.) To run this program, type the
 following:

 myprompt


 The first line, "@echo off", is found in most batch programs. It prevents
 each batch command from being echoed on your screen as it is being processed
 by the command interpreter.

 The second line, "rem This is a simple batch program", is a comment
 statement used to add notes to batch files. The command interpreter does not
 process rem statements when echoing is turned off, so you are free to add
 whatever comments you want to your batch programs.

 The next line, "prompt", is the MS OS/2 command you use to change the
 command prompt in the current session. By placing this command in a batch
 file, you only have to remember or look up the options once.

 It is a good idea to remove blank lines from batch files, since each blank
 line will cause the command prompt to be displayed when the program is run.


 Setting Up Your Environment with a Batch Program

 One common way to use batch programs is to
 set up your environment. For example, you can set environment variables such
 as PATH and PROMPT in an initialization file.

 Suppose you want to create a system initialization file called OS2INIT.CMD.
 You want to set the OS/2 session environment variable TMP in this file, as
 well as switch to your HOME directory and start the SP spreadsheet program
 in the current session. OS2INIT.CMD would look like this:

 @echo off
 set TMP=c:\tmp
 cd \home
 start /f sp


 You could type these commands at the command prompt each time you start MS
 OS/2, but putting them in a batch file will save you time and effort.


 Displaying a Message with a Batch Program

 The following example creates a batch program that displays the message,
 "Use echo to display a message." Use System Editor or another text editor to
 create a file named SPECIAL.CMD, and then type the following:

 @echo off
 rem This program displays a message
 echo Use echo to display a message.


 You can use the rem batch command to add comments to your program. Any text
 after rem that is on the same line is treated as a comment. If the echo
 feature is on, rem commands are displayed as your program runs; if echoing
 is turned off (as in this example), no text is displayed.

 The @echo off command turns off the echo feature (the default setting has
 this feature turned on). This prevents the commands from being displayed on
 the screen as they are processed. The at sign (@) prevents the string "echo
 off" from being displayed as it turns the feature off. The @echo off command
 is often used at the beginning of batch programs to prevent unnecessary
 output from cluttering up your screen.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 When you are running a batch program in an OS/2 session, you can also turn
 echoing off by typing the /q option as an argument to the command that
 starts your batch program. For this reason, do not use /q as an argument to
 any command in your batch file.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 When echoing is off, you can use the echo command to display the text that
 follows it on the same line. You might want to display messages in your
 batch program to inform yourself or other users of what is taking place as
 the program runs or to inform them of error conditions that have occurred.


 Creating a Custom Command

 After using MS OS/2 for a while, you might find that there are commands and
 utilities that you use on a daily basis. You can create custom versions of
 these commands that incorporate the options that you always use. As an
 example, suppose that you work in a complex multilevel directory structure
 that contains many subdirectories. Also suppose that you must return to your
 root directory several times a day. To help you do this, you can create a
 customized version of the cd command. Your version will display the message,
 "Returning to the root directory", switch you to the root directory on drive
 C, and display the directory list for the root directory one screenful at a
 time. To set up this special version of the cd command, type the following
 lines in a file called HOME.CMD in your root directory:

 @echo off
 echo Returning to the root directory
 c:
 cd \
 dir /p


 Now, no matter what drive or directory you are in, you only need to type
 home and MS OS/2 will return you to the root directory on drive C. .ET


 Performing a Series of Tasks with a Batch Program

 A common use of batch programs is to perform copying operations to update
 files or to create backup disks. Suppose that you have specific files in
 particular directories on a floppy disk that are updated on a weekly basis,
 and that they then need to be copied to particular directories on your hard
 disk. Suppose further that the specific files you are interested in are all
 of the files that contain the extensions .EXE and .LIB and all of the files
 in your INCLUDE directory, plus the file README.DOC from the root directory.
 This copying operation involves the following steps:

   1.  Copy all the .EXE files that are in the NEW directory on your floppy
       disk to the BIN directory on your hard disk.

   2.  Copy all the

   3.  B files in the NEW directory on your floppy disk to the LIB
       subdirectory of the BIN directory on your hard disk.

   4.  Copy all the files in the INCLUDE directory on your floppy disk to the
       INC directory on your hard disk.

   5.  Copy the README.DOC file from the root directory on your floppy disk
       to the root directory on your hard disk.


 You can create a batch program that performs each of these steps by typing
 the following in a file named TRANSFER.CMD:

 @echo off
 rem This batch program copies files from drive A to drive C
 echo Copying files ...
 copy a:\new\*.exe c:\bin
 copy a:\new\*.lib c:\bin\lib
 copy a:\include\*.* c:\inc
 copy a:\readme.doc c:\readme.doc


 .RT The copy commands in the batch file perform the same operations as they
 would if they were typed on the command line. In this example, the exact
 files and directories to copy have been specified in the batch file. In
 later sections, you will see how you can let a user type in arguments to a
 batch program.

 To run this program, type transfer and press ENTER. The .CMD extension is
 optional. You will see the copy command display the files being copied as
 the copying operation progresses.

 Copying files ...
 A:\NEW\MOVE.EXE
 A:\NEW\TEST.EXE
        2 file(s) copied.
 A:\NEW\SLIBCE.LIB
 A:\NEW\MLIBCE.LIB
 A:\NEW\LLIBCE.LIB
        3 file(s) copied.
 A:\INCLUDE\OS2.H
 A:\INCLUDE\TYPES.H
 A:\INCLUDE\STDIO.H
 A:\INCLUDE\OS2DEF.H
        4 file(s) copied.
 A:\README.DOC
        1 file(s) copied.


 .ET


 Using Advanced Batch-File Techniques

 In addition to the basic tasks you can perform by using a batch program,
 there are more advanced techniques that will make your programs more
 flexible and powerful. For example, you can program your batch file so that
 it accepts parameters on the command line. You can also set conditions
 within batch files so that tasks are performed when those conditions are
 met. This section describes these advanced batch-file techniques.


 Using Replaceable Parameters

 The Transfer program used in the preceding section illustrates how one
 program can perform several copying operations. These operations are fixed,
 since there is no way to specify which files are copied. But you can also
 write a batch program that allows you to specify which files to copy.

 Batch programs can contain a special symbol called a replaceable parameter.
 This symbol is a percent sign (%) followed by a digit from 0 through 9. The
 replaceable parameters in a batch program .RT are assigned values when you
 type the command and options. For example, suppose you type the transfer
 command followed by three arguments, as follows:

 transfer \ebin \elib \einc


 If you use the %0, %1, %2, and %3 parameters in your batch file, %0 will be
 replaced by "transfer", %1 by "\ebin", %2 by "\elib", and %3 by "\einc".

 The Transfer program created earlier can be changed so that you can specify
 on the command line whether you want the files from the BIN, INC, or LIB
 directories to be copied from a floppy disk in drive A to your hard disk. To
 accomplish this, you will need three features: the if batch command, the
 goto batch command, and the pause batch command.


 Using the If Batch Command

 The if batch command causes a command to be carried out if a certain
 condition is true. The if command can have one of the following forms:

 Form                              Description
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 if string1==string2 command       Compares the character string string1
                                   with string2. If they are the same,
                                   command is processed.

 if exist filename command         Checks whether the named file exists. If
                                   the file does exist, command is
                                   processed.

 if errorlevel number command      Checks the exit code of the command or
                                   program that was run just before the if
                                   statement. If the command or program
                                   returns an exit code that is equal to or
                                   greater than the number specified,
                                   command is processed. (For information
                                   about exit codes, see "Checking the
                                   Error Level," later in this chapter.)

 The if not batch command causes a command to be carried out if a certain
 condition is not true. For example, if not exist filename command processes
 command if the filename does not exist.


 Using the Goto Batch Command

 The goto batch command directs your program to switch to a different part of
 the file and continue processing the commands at that point. The goto
 command has the following form:

 goto label


 The way you tell the program what part of the file to switch to is by using
 a label. The label is any string of characters (which may or may not form a
 word) that you put in the file, on a line by itself, at the point where you
 want your program to continue processing commands. For example, goto end
 will cause processing to continue at the command found after the label
 ":end". You identify a label in the batch file by typing a colon (:) in
 front of it.


 Using the Pause Batch Command

 The pause batch command temporarily stops your program from running and
 displays the message, "Press any key when ready . . . ."

 You can continue running the program by pressing a key, or you can quit the
 program by pressing CTRL+C.


 Modifying the Transfer Batch Program

 The following example shows the usage of the batch commands just described.
 As you see here, you can modify the Transfer program so that the first
 argument typed on the command line is used in the batch file:

 @echo off
 rem This batch program lets you decide which directory to copy
 echo Copying files from %1
 pause
 if "%1"=="" goto end
 if %1==\ebin goto copybin
 if %1==\einc goto copyinc
 if %1==\elib goto copylib
 echo %1: Unknown option
 goto end
 :copybin
 copy a:\bin\*.* c:\bin
 goto end
 :copyinc
 copy a:\inc\*.* c:\inc
 goto end
 :copylib
 copy a:\lib\*.* c:\lib
 :end


 The %1 parameter is used in the echo command to display whatever argument
 you type. The pause command lets you determine whether to continue copying
 or quit the program by pressing CTRL+C.

 The program uses the first if command, if "%1"=="" goto end, to check
 whether you have typed an argument. If no argument is found, the command
 causes the program to jump to the label ":end". When you are specifying no
 argument in an if command, you must use quotation marks; if you are
 specifying an argument, the quotation marks are optional.

 The next three if commands cause the first argument that you type to be
 substituted for %1 and compared to the strings "\ebin", "\einc", and
 "\elib". If a match occurs, the program jumps to the ":copybin", ":copyinc",
 or ":copylib" label, respectively. After the program has copied the files,
 the goto command causes the program to jump to the ":end" label. Notice that
 if you type in an argument other than "\ebin", "\einc", or "\elib" (that is,
 if none of the if conditions were true), the message "Unknown option" is
 displayed and the program jumps to the ":end" label.


 Specifying Multiple Arguments

 To make your program more powerful, you will probably want to be able to
 specify more than one argument after the batch program. For example, the
 Transfer program that you created previously processes only the first
 argument typed. It ignores any additional arguments.

 To specify two directories, you could modify the Transfer program to include
 the following lines:

 if %1==\ebin goto copybin
 if %1==\elib goto copylib
 if %2==\ebin goto copybin
 if %2==\elib goto copylib


 Both %1 and %2 would be compared to the strings "\ebin" and "\elib" and sent
 to the appropriate copy command. But suppose that you want the option of
 typing up to 10 arguments after the transfer command, with the arguments
 specified in any order. You would need many if commands to test for every
 possible combination of arguments. One way to do this is to use the shift
 batch command. This command lets your program process any number of
 arguments that are typed in any order. Each time shift is carried out, the
 program processes the next argument in the file. To see how this works,
 create a file named DISPLAY.CMD with the following lines:

 @echo off
 rem This displays a list of arguments
 :displayarg
 if "%1"=="" goto end
 echo %%1 is now %1
 shift
 goto displayarg
 :end


 Then type display followed by a list of numbers for each argument. As it
 runs, the program will display each number on a line of its own. The
 statement if "%1"=="" checks to see whether all of the arguments have been
 read. In this example, two percent signs (%%) are used to display the actual
 percent character ("%1") instead of the %1 argument.

 Now you can modify the Transfer program to accept any number of arguments,
 as follows:

 @echo off
 rem Copying multiple directories
 pause
 :chkargs
 echo Copying files from %1
 if "%1"=="" goto end
 if %1==\ebin goto copybin
 if %1==\einc goto copyinc
 if %1==\elib goto copylib
 echo %1: Unknown option
 goto end
 :copybin
 copy a:*.exe c:\bin
 shift
 goto chkargs
 :copyinc
 copy a:*.inc c:\inc
 shift
 goto chkargs
 :copylib
 copy a:lib c:\lib
 shift
 goto chkargs
 :end


 The program compares each argument that the user types to the strings
 "\ebin", "\elib", and "\einc", as it did before. But the goto statements now
 direct the program to return to the ":chkargs" label after each argument is
 processed. Thus, you can type any number of valid arguments in any order,
 and the effect is the same.


 Repeating a Task

 Sometimes, you may want to perform a task on
 a set of different elements. For example, you may want to type out the
 contents of three files, or you may want to copy several directories from a
 floppy disk to a directory on your hard disk. The for statement lets you
 specify the set of elements that a command will work with. To see its use,
 type the following lines in a file called COUNT.CMD:

 @echo off
 for %%x in (One Two Three) do echo %%x


 If you now type count, the following appears:

 One
 Two
 Three


 The for command causes the batch processor to substitute each element in the
 parentheses, one at a time, for "%%x". (You can use any single character in
 place of x.) Then the program processes whatever command appears after the
 do command.

 In the preceding example, each element in the set (One Two Three) is
 substituted for "%%x", then "%%x" is echoed to the screen. So the first time
 through the program, "One" is displayed; the second time, "Two" is
 displayed; and the third time, "Three" is displayed. Thus, the command takes
 the place of typing the echo command three times. In a batch file, you must
 use two percent signs (%%) in front of the x to distinguish a for variable
 from a replaceable parameter.

 The following batch file, called BINCOPY.CMD, allows you to copy the
 contents of up to three directories that are in the current directory to
 your BIN directory on drive C:

 @echo off
 rem Updating %1 %2 %3
 for %%x in (%1 %2 %3) do if not exist %%x goto end
 for %%x in (%1 %2 %3) do copy %%x c:\bin
 :end


 The first for command checks to see whether all of the directories exist. It
 does this by first substituting the arguments that you type for %1, %2, and
 %3, and then it uses the if not exist command after the do command to check
 to see that all of the directories do exist. If a directory does not exist,
 the program ends. The second for command does the actual copying by
 substituting each argument, one at a time, for the "%%x" in the copy
 command.


 Calling Another Batch Program

 You can run, or call, one batch program from another batch program by using
 the call command. When the batch processor encounters this command, it
 passes control to the "called" program. When the program is finished
 running, control returns to the original program.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you start a second batch program from a batch program without using call,
 the second program will run. However, control will not return automatically
 to the original batch program after the second program finishes running. You
 must use the call command if you want control to be passed back to the
 original program.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 For example, a main batch program could call other batch programs to perform
 the actual operations. The following short batch program calls the batch
 file COPY1.CMD if /c is typed as an argument, or it calls the batch file
 DEL1.CMD if /d is typed as an argument:
 @echo off
 rem This batch file calls other batch files
 if %1==/c call copy1
 if %1==/d call del1


 The batch files COPY1.CMD and DEL1.CMD perform the actual copying or
 deleting, then they return control to the original batch file.

 You cannot use pipes or redirection symbols with the call command. A batch
 file can call itself, but it should contain a command that ends it so that
 you do not remain in an infinite loop.


 Setting Variables in Your Batch Program

 You have the option of using variables in your batch programs. These
 variables are saved in your environment just like the PATH environment
 variable. To set a variable in your batch program, use the set command. For
 example, to set the variable STDERR to NUL, include the following line in
 your batch program:

 set stderr=^>nul


 Notice that in a batch file you must use the escape character (^) before the
 redirection symbol (>). The escape character (which is described later in
 this chapter) tells the batch processor to treat the greater-than symbol as
 a character, rather than processing it as a redirection symbol. Thus, the
 string "2>nul" is simply assigned to STDERR without being processed.

 If you type set after running the program, you will see that STDERR has been
 saved in your environment. To prevent it from being saved, you can type the
 following to delete the setting:

 set stderr=


 There are several ways to use variables in batch files. Suppose you need to
 create a master phone list every week from various phone-list files in
 different directories. You want to be able to just type the names of the
 files that contain the phone lists and have them collected in a file called
 PHONE.LST for later viewing. You decide that you need a batch file that will
 delete the old phone list, then create a new phone list that contains any
 phone files you specify on the command line. The batch file will then
 discard any error messages and display the new phone list on the screen.

 @echo off
 rem This batch file creates a new phone list
 del phone.lst
 :newphone
 if "%1"=="" goto displayit
 set stdout=^>^>phone.lst & set stderr=2^>nul
 type %1 %stdout%
 shift
 goto newphone
 rem Now display the phone list
 :displayit
 type phone.lst %stderr%


 When you run this batch file, STDOUT is replaced by the string ">phone.lst",
 which appends output to the file PHONE.LST. So when the type %1 %stdout%
 command is run, %1 is replaced by the first argument typed, and the contents
 of the file specified are appended to the PHONE.LST file.

 When the phone list is displayed, STDERR is replaced by the string "2>nul",
 which redirects error messages encountered while sending the output of the
 file to NUL. Notice that the ampersand (&) (which is described later in this
 chapter) separates the two operations.

 As before, STDOUT and STDERR are saved as variables in your environment
 after the program ends. You could assign STDOUT or STDERR to null values
 after you run the batch program, or you could set variables that are local
 to your batch program by using the setlocal and endlocal batch commands.
 Just place setlocal at the beginning of the program and place endlocal at
 the end of the program. This tells the batch processor that any variables
 you set are active only while the batch program is running. After you run
 your program, these variables are not saved in your environment.

 To see how these commands work, look at the batch file LOCAL.CMD:

 @echo off
 setlocal
 rem This program keeps the variables STDERR and MYVAR from
 rem being saved in your environment.
 if "%1"=="" echo Valid arguments /s /m & goto end
 if %1==/s set stderr=errfile
 if %1==/m set myvar="Hi there!"
 set
 :end
 endlocal


 This program assigns the variable STDERR to the file ERRFILE (if the user
 types /s), and assigns the variable MYVAR to the string "Hi there!" (if the
 user types /m). It then carries out the set command, which displays your
 environment settings. You will see that either STDERR or MYVAR appears in
 the list of environment variables. However, if you type set after running
 the batch program Local, STDERR or MYVAR will not appear as environment
 variables (unless you have set one of them previously).


 Checking the Error Level

 Some MS OS/2 commands and utilities return an exit code when they are
 completed; that is, they send a number back to the system to tell it whether
 the program ran successfully or not. If the command or utility ran
 successfully, it returns an exit code of zero; if it did not run
 successfully, it returns an exit code greater than zero. You can check this
 value and specify what command will then run by placing the command if
 errorlevel (or if not errorlevel) immediately following the line that runs
 the original command or utility. The if errorlevel command checks to see
 whether the exit code is equal to or greater than the number you specify.

 For example, you could run the format utility in a batch file, check to see
 that the formatting operation was successful (returned an exit code of
 zero), and display a message on the screen by running the following program:


 @echo off
 format a:
 if errorlevel 1 echo A formatting error occurred. & goto end
 echo Format successful
 :end


 If the utility returns an exit code of greater than zero, an error message
 is displayed and processing jumps to the label ":end". Otherwise, the
 message "Format successful" is displayed.


 Using Special Characters in a Batch Program


 In Chapter 8, "Running Cmd," you learned how redirection and
 ipe symbols (<,>, >, and | ) could be used to specify more than one command
 on a line. The following symbols also have special meaning to MS OS/2:
 Symbol                            Meaning
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 ^                                 Removes a special character's meaning.

 ( )                               Groups commands.

 &                                 Separates multiple commands.

 &&                                Performs one operation, then another.

 ||                                Performs one operation or another.

 While these special characters can all be used on the command line, they are
 most useful in batch programs. In the following sections, each of these
 special characters is described.

 Removing a Special Character's Function

 To remove the meaning of special characters, use the escape character (^)
 before the character. This lets you use special characters as regular
 characters in a string.

 For example, to redirect the line "hello" into a file named GREET, type the
 following:

 echo hello > greet


 If you use the escape character before the redirection symbol, the
 redirection symbol loses its meaning. To have the batch processor treat the
 redirection symbol as an ordinary character, type the following:

 echo hello ^> greet


 Now the entire line is echoed to your screen:

 hello > greet


 This is useful if you want to display a special character but do not want
 the symbol to perform any function.

 Grouping Commands

 To group commands, use parentheses [( )]. For example, to display the sorted
 output of a directory listing of drive A and the contents of the file
 DIR.LST on drive C, type the following:

 (dir a: & type c:dir.lst) | sort




 Combining Commands

 To combine several commands, separate each command from the others with the
 ampersand (&). For example, to display a directory list for drive A, the
 version of MS OS/2, and the volume label of your current drive, type the
 following:

 dir a: & ver & vol


 MS OS/2 processes the individual commands in order, from left to right.

 Using the AND Operator


 The AND operator (&&) processes the command to the left of the symbol. If the
 command is successful, it processes the command to the right of the symbol.
 If the first command is unsuccessful (that is, produces an error), the
 command to the right is not processed.
 For example, the following command displays the contents of the file BUDGET

 dir budget




 Using the OR Operator

 The OR operator (||) processes either the command to the left of the symbol
 or the command to the right. If the command to the left is successful, it
 does not process the command to the right. If the command to the left is
 unsuccessful (that is, produces an error), the command to the right is
 processed.

 For example, the following command either deletes the file called LETTER.TMP
 or displays a directory list of all files with the filename extension .TMP:

 del letter.tmp || dir *.tmp


 If LETTER.TMP exists, it is deleted. If LETTER.TMP does not exist, a
 directory list of all the files with the .TMP extension is displayed.

 This part of the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's Guide provides
 information to help you configure and maintain your system.

 One chapter describes utilities and commands you can use to perform such
 system-maintenance tasks as making backup copies of your files and
 configuring and formatting your hard disk. Another explains how to set up
 your hard disk by using the Presentation Manager Fixed Disk Utility.

 Two more chapters present an overview of the start-up files you can use in
 MS OS/2 and how to customize your working environment by using configuration
 commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 The new high-performance file system (HPFS) is discussed in a chapter that
 tells you how to install HPFS, how it is different from the file allocation
 table (FAT) file system, and how some MS OS/2 commands and utilities work
 differently in HPFS than they do in the FAT file system.

 The last chapter explains how to use device drivers to support new hardware
 or enable additional features of MS OS/2.

 Introduction


 This chapter is designed to help you with the tasks of
 aintaining your system, including maintaining your files, directories, and
 disks. It describes the MS OS/2 disk utilities that you use to perform tasks
 such as displaying information about a disk and backing up and restoring
 files, and it describes how you can use the mode utility to provide
 information about devices for MS OS/2.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 All examples of filenames and directory names in this chapter use the file
 allocation table (FAT) file system, which is the file system used by DOS and
 MS OS/2 versions 1.1 and earlier. For information on using high-performance
 file system (HPFS) filenames and directory names, see Chapter 16, "Using the
 High-Performance File System."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Using MS OS/2 Disk Utilities

 MS OS/2 provides utilities that help you work with and maintain disks. The
 following list describes these utilities:

 Utility                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 chkdsk                            Displays status information about a disk.

 backup                            Makes backup copies of files.

 restore                           Restores backup files.

 recover                           Recovers a file or disk that contains
                                   bad sectors.

 The backup and restore utilities work only in an OS/2 session. You can run
 the chkdsk and recover utilities in both DOS and OS/2 sessions.

 Unlike commands and utilities that operate on files and directories, disk
 utilities are designed to help you prepare and maintain floppy and hard
 disks.


 Displaying Disk Information

 The chkdsk utility displays status information about a disk and checks the
 disk for errors. You should run this utility periodically to keep track of
 how much space is left on a disk and to display any errors found on the
 disk. If chkdsk finds an error, a message describing the error appears on
 the screen.

 You can start the chkdsk utility from the DOS session, an OS/2 session, or
 the Utilities group in Desktop Manager.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 This section describes the chkdsk utility as it works in the MS OS/2 file
 allocation table (FAT) file system. For a description of the chkdsk utility
 as it works in the high-performance file system (HPFS), see Chapter 16,
 "Using the High-Performance File System."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 To run chkdsk, you type chkdsk followed by a drive letter or filename.
 Chkdsk always checks a drive; you can also check a file by specifying a
 filename. (You can specify multiple filenames by using wildcard characters.)
 If you specify a filename, chkdsk checks the drive and also tells you
 whether the specified file is contiguous. (You can specify a directory path
 with the filename.) If you do not specify a drive, chkdsk checks the current
 drive.
 For example, to check your hard disk and save the output in the file
 REPORT.DSK on drive A, type the following:

 chkdsk c: > a:report


 A typical status report might look like the following:

 The type of file system for disk is FAT.
 The volume label is RALPH.
  The Volume Serial Number is E392-1C15

  72286208 bytes total disk space.
    311296 bytes in 7 hidden files.
    520192 bytes in 125 directories.
  67895296 bytes in 2443 user files.
     12288 bytes in bad sectors.
   3547136 bytes available on disk.

      4096 bytes in each allocation unit.
     17648 total allocation units.
       866 available allocation units on disk.




 The message about hidden files gives you the number of files that are needed
 by the system but are not shown when you use the dir command to display a
 directory list. To discover the names of hidden files, use chkdsk with the
 /v option (described later in this chapter, in "Displaying Each File on Your
 Disk"), or use File Manager in the Presentation Manager session.

 The "bytes in bad sectors" message shows you how many of the sec- tors on
 your disk are defective. Since the system automatically compensates for bad
 sectors, there is no reason to worry about them unless the number of bad
 sectors becomes very large.

 The "bytes available on disk" message shows you the number of unused bytes
 on the disk. You should check this value from time to time, especially if
 disk space is limited.

 MS OS/2 files are stored in a series of units called sectors, which are
 grouped into larger units called clusters. The chkdsk utility may report
 that it has found lost clusters. A lost cluster still exists, but the
 information in it is no longer associated with a file. This could occur for
 many reasonsÄfor example, if you turned off your computer while the system
 was writing to a file. When a cluster is lost, MS OS/2 cannot read, write,
 or modify the data in it. If part of a file is in a lost cluster, you will
 not be able to work with the file at all. In addition, lost clusters take up
 valuable disk space.

 If you use the /f option, chkdsk fixes any lost clusters by writing them to
 a file. For instructions on how to use the /f option, see the following
 section.

 If you specify files to be checked when you use the chkdsk utility, you will
 receive a message that tells you whether the files are stored in contiguous
 sectors. If a file is not stored in contiguous sectors, the num- ber of its
 blocks that are stored in noncontiguous sectors is displayed. Although
 storing files in contiguous sectors is not required, it enables your
 computer to read from or write to files more efficiently. If many of your
 files are stored in noncontiguous sectors, you can make all files contiguous
 by backing up the files on your disk, reformatting the disk, and restoring
 the files to the disk.


 Fixing Errors on Your Disk


 To fix errors on your disk, use chkdsk with the /f option. You can use the
 copy of the chkdsk utility that was put onto your start-up disk when you
 installed MS OS/2 to fix errors on any disk except your start-up disk. This
 means that if you normally start MS OS/2 from drive C, you can fix errors
 only on disks that are in drives other than drive C. To fix errors on drive
 C, do the following:
   1.  Insert the MS OS/2 Install disk into drive A and turn on your
       computer. If your computer is already on, restart it by pressing
       CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   2.  At the first screen, press the ESC key. This takes you to the command
       prompt.

   3.  Insert the disk that contains the CHKDSK

   4.  Type chkdsk c: /f and press the ENTER key.


 The chkdsk utility attempts to recover lost clusters and places their
 contents into files that have the name FILEnnnn.CHK, where nnnn is a
 sequential number assigned by MS OS/2. The recovered files may or may not be
 usable, depending upon their condition.

 If the files with lost clusters are ASCII files (data files), you may be
 able to recover the lost data. If you find that there is text missing from
 an ASCII file, run chkdsk with the /f option, then do the following:

   1.  Use the type command to look at the contents of each of the .CHK
       files.

   2.  If the missing text appears in one of the .CHK files, use a text
       editor to copy this text back into the original file.


 In MS OS/2, some applications attach additional information, such as author,
 application type, and file history, to your files and directories. These
 pieces of information are called extended attributes and are used by other
 applications, the file system, or the operating system itself. If chkdsk
 finds errors in extended attributes, the recovered extended attributes are
 placed in files named EAnnnn.CHK, where nnnn is a sequential number assigned
 by MS OS/2.

 You can look at files that have extended attributes by using the type
 command, as described previously. If after using the type command you can
 identify which of your files the extended attributes belong to, you can join
 the extended attributes to the files by using the eautil utility. For
 information about using eautil, see the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command
 Reference.


 Displaying Each File on Your Disk

 Use the /v option if you want the name of each file on the disk to be
 displayed as it is being checked. The /v option causes the chkdsk utility to
 display all files, including hidden files. (However, the hidden files are
 not flagged in any way.) Discovering which files are hidden files requires
 some checking. If you need to know the names of the hidden files, follow
 these steps:

   1.  Use the chkdsk utility without the /v option. This tells you the
       number of hidden files; however, it does not tell you the names of the
       files.

   2.  Use the chkdsk utility with the /v option to produce a list of all of
       the files on a particular drive.

   3.  Use the dir command to produce a file list that does not show any
       hidden files.

   4.  Compare these two lists. Any file that is in the chkdsk /v list but is
       not in the dir list is a hidden file. You can use the number produced
       in step one to make sure you have found every hidden file.




 Since chkdsk /v displays filenames left-aligned, you can easily use the sort
 utility to sort filenames and directories alphabetically. The sort utility
 is described in detail in Chapter 9, "Using MS OS/2 Utilities."


 Making Backup Copies of Your Files

 The backup utility creates a backup copy of one or more files on a disk and
 stores the copy on another disk. It provides an easy way to make backup
 copies of files, directories, or entire disks. Using backup differs from
 using the copy command or the xcopy utility to copy files; when you use
 backup to copy files, the contents of the files are stored in a single file,
 instead of in individual files. In addition, backup has several options that
 let you make backup copies of specific files.

 The backup utility is most commonly used to make backup copies of files that
 are on your hard disk and store them on a series of floppy disks. You can
 use these floppy disks to recover your files if the hard disk becomes
 corrupted.

 You can back up one floppy disk to another floppy disk even if the disks
 have a different number of sides or sectors. The backup utility does not
 make copies of files if the files are already open or if they are in use by
 another program. For example, if you run backup from your start-up disk,
 files such as the OS2.INI file and the SWAPPER.DAT file are not backed up
 because they are being used by MS OS/2. To back up these files by using the
 backup utility, follow these steps:

   1.  Insert the MS OS/2 Install disk into drive A and turn on your
       computer. If your computer is already on, restart it by pressing
       CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   2.  At the first screen, press ESC. This takes you to the command prompt.

   3.  Insert the disk that contains the BACKUP

   4.  Start the backup utility. You can make backup copies of individual
       files or of the entire start-up disk.


 To restore these files to the start-up disk, run the restore utility from
 drive A, in the same way as described in the preceding steps.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 The backup utility does not make backup copies of the files OS2LDR, OS2KRNL,
 CMD.EXE or COMMAND
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 Making Backup Files on Another Disk

 To run the backup utility, type backup followed by the drive that contains
 the disk you want to back up (the source disk) and the drive that contains
 the disk that will hold the backup files (the backup disk).

 To back up the contents of your current directory to a directory in another
 drive, you specify the drive letters of the source drive and the backup
 drive. For example, to back up the root directory of your hard disk (drive
 C) to a floppy disk in drive A, type the following:

 backup c: a:


 To make a backup copy of the contents of a specified directory, you type the
 drive letter and path of the directory you want to copy. For example, to
 back up the files in the ORDERS subdirectory of the ACCOUNT directory to a
 floppy disk in drive A, type the following:

 backup c:\account\orders a:


 Suppose you have several files on your hard disk that have the filename
 extension .OLD. To back up these files to a floppy disk in drive B, use a
 wildcard character, as shown in the following:

 backup c:\account\orders\*.old b:


 By default, any files on the backup floppy disk are erased before the backup
 files are added to it. If all of the files cannot fit on one floppy disk,
 the backup utility prompts you to insert another backup disk when the
 current disk is filled.

 When the backup operation is complete and you look at a directory list for
 the backup disk, you will not see the names of the files you just copied.
 Instead, you will see two files named BACKUP.nnn and CONTROL.nnn. These
 files contain your files and paths; they will be used later to restore these
 files. On the first backup disk, these two files will be called BACKUP.001
 and CONTROL.001; on the second disk, they will be called BACKUP.002 and
 CONTROL.002, and so on.

 If you copy files to a hard disk, backup automatically creates a directory
 called BACKUP, which contains the BACKUP and CONTROL files.

 The backup utility automatically formats an unformatted floppy disk before
 saving backup copies on it.

 Making Backup Copies of Subdirectories


 If you use the backup utility without options, only the files or directory
 you specify are copied. To copy several directories or an entire disk, you
 can use the /s option. The /s option enables you to create backup copies of
 subdirectories. For example, to back up your hard disk (drive C), including
 all subdirectories, to floppy disks in drive A, type the following:
 backup c: a: /s


 The original directory structure is maintained while all files and
 directories are copied to drive A.

 Making Backup Copies of Files Modified Since the Last Backup Operation

 The backup utility can use the archive file flag to determine which files to
 back up. If you use the /m option, only those files that have been modified
 since the last backup operation are copied to the backup disk. However, the
 previous backup files will be deleted from the backup disk (unless you use
 the /a option, as described later).

 Whenever you use backup, those files for which the archive flag is set are
 found and copied. The backup utility then turns off the archive flag for
 those files. When you make a backup copy of the same set of files and use
 the /m option, the archive flag is set only for those files that have been
 created or modified since the last backup operation. Therefore, only they
 will be backed up. (The /m option may not perform as described here if you
 use the attrib utility to modify the archive flags of the files.)

 You can also use the /m option to make copies of directories. When you use
 this option, the backup utility makes a copy of a directory only if its
 extended attributes have changed since the last backup operation.

 Adding Files to the Backup Disk

 By default, the contents of the backup floppy disk or BACKUP directory are
 erased before the backup files are added to it. If you want to add files to
 an existing backup disk or directory without modifying the current contents,
 use the /a option. Suppose your backup floppy disk contains the contents of
 the ENG directory and you need to make a backup copy of the MKT directory.
 You could make a second backup disk, or you could add the contents of MKT to
 the existing backup disk by using the /a option. To add the second directory
 to the backup disk, type the following:

 backup c:\emkt a: /a


 The BACKUP and CONTROL files now contain backup copies of the contents of
 both the ENG and MKT directories. Any other files that were on the backup
 disk remain unchanged.

 Making Backup Copies of Files Modified After a Certain Date and Time


 You may be interested in backing up only those files that were modified after
 a certain date and time. To do this, use the /d:date option and, optionally,
 the /t:time option. Note that /t cannot be used without /d.
 Suppose you wanted to back up only those files that were modified after the
 beginning of 1988. You would run the backup utility and specify the date and
 time, as follows:

 backup c: a: /d:12-31-87 /t:23:59


 Any files that were modified after 11:59 P.M. on December 31, 1987, would be
 copied.

 Making a Backup Log

 The /l[:logfile] option lets you create a log of the files you have copied
 by using the backup utility. This log contains a list of entries, one entry
 per file. Each entry contains the number of the backup disk and the name of
 the file. This information can be used to restore a particular file from a
 floppy disk.

 Unless you specify otherwise, the log file is created in the root directory
 of the source disk or source drive. If you do not specify a log-file name,
 the log file is named BACKUP.LOG. For example, suppose you want to back up
 the contents of the MKT directory on drive C to a floppy disk in drive A. To
 create a backup log on drive C called MKTLOG.001, type the following:

 backup c: a: /l:mktlog.001




 Preserving Extended Attributes

 In MS OS/2, some applications attach additional information, such as author,
 application type, and file history, to your files and directories. These
 pieces of information are called extended attributes and are used by other
 applications, the file system, or the operating system itself. The backup
 utility automatically preserves the extended attributes of a file or
 directory.


 Restoring Backup Files

 To restore backup files to a disk, use the restore utility. The restore
 utility can restore files between similar or different disk types. Many of
 the options of the restore utility are analogous to the options of the
 backup utility.

 Restoring Files to a Disk

 To restore files that were copied by using the backup utility, you type
 restore followed by the drive that contains the disk with the backup fileswil
 directories from which they were copied.

 For example, if you have a floppy disk that contains backup files, you need
 only insert it in drive A and type the following to restore the files to the
 BAK directory on drive C:

 restore a: c:\bak




 Restoring Subdirectories

 If you made backup copies of subdirectories by using the /s option of the
 backup utility, you can restore these subdirectories by using the /s option
 of the restore utility. For example, to restore all of the backup files in
 drive A to the current directory in drive C, type the following:

 restore a: c: /s




 Prompting the User Before Restoring Files

 The directory being restored may contain read-only files or files that have
 been modified since the last backup operation; you may not want to restore
 these files. The /p option displays a warning message and prompts the user
 with "Replace the file (Y/N)?" To restore the backup file, type Y for yes.
 To leave the file unchanged, type N for no.

 Selecting Files to Restore


 Just as you can make backup copies based on the time or date a file was
 created or last modified, you can also restore files based on the time or
 date. The options that you can use with restore are as follows:
 Option                            Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 /b:date                           Restores only those files that were last
                                   modified on or before date.

 /a:date                           Restores only those files that were last
                                   modified on or after date.

 /e:time                           Restores only those files that were last
                                   modified at or earlier than time.

 /L:time                           Restores only those files that were last
                                   modified at or later than time.

 /m                                Restores only those files that were
                                   modified after the last backup.

 You can combine options, if you like.

 These options work only if the filenames on the source drive are the same as
 those on the destination drive. In other words, if you are restoring files
 to an empty directory or to a directory that contains filenames that are
 different from the backup filenames, these options do not apply. For
 example, suppose that you want to update a phone list periodically from a
 backup floppy disk that is made from the company's master phone lists.
 Suppose also that you want to restore the list to a direc- tory named \PHONE
 on drive C. To update those phone lists that have not been modified since a
 specified date, you could use the /b and /m options, as follows:

 restore a: c:\phone /b:5-14-89 /m


 The /b option specifies only those files that were last modified on or
 before May 14, 1989. The /m option specifies those files that have the
 archive flag set, which means that the file has been modified since the last
 backup operation.

 Restoring Files That Are Not on the Destination Drive

 To restore only those files from the backup
 disk that do not currently exist on the destination drive, use the /n
 option.

 For example, suppose you have the files TEMP1.BAK, TEMP2.BAK, and TEMP3.BAK
 on a backup disk, and that TEMP1.BAK and TEMP2.BAK already exist in the
 destination directory. If you use the /n option, only TEMP3.BAK will be
 restored.

 Preserving Extended Attributes

 The restore utility, like the backup utility, preserves the extended
 attributes of a file or directory. If you are restoring files that have
 extended attributes to a file system that does not support extended
 attributes, you may want to use the /f option with the restore utility. For
 more information about the restore utility, see the Microsoft Operating
 System/2 Command Reference.


 Recovering a File from a Damaged Disk

 If a sector on your disk is damaged, you can use the recover utility to try
 to recover either just the file that has been written to the damaged sector
 or the entire disk.

 Before using this utility, be sure that you have backup copies of all the
 files on your disk. Then try to restore your files by using the restore
 utility. If this fails, use the recover utility on one file at a time. Use
 recover on a disk only if the entire disk is unreadable.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 This section describes the recover utility as it works with the MS OS/2 file
 allocation table (FAT) file system. For a description of the recover utility
 as it works with the high-performance file system (HPFS), see Chapter 16,
 "Using the High-Performance File System."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 To recover one file, you type recover followed by the name of the file you
 want to recover. MS OS/2 reads the file sector by sector, skipping the bad
 sectors, and labels any bad sectors so that no data is written to them in
 the future.

 To recover an entire disk, you type recover followed by the drive letter.

 The recover utility does not work on a network from a remote workstation,
 nor does it work on drives that are used with the assign, subst, or join
 utility. When you use the recover utility on a disk, no other program can
 access that disk while the utility is running. This prevents other programs
 from modifying the disk while recover is modifying it. Likewise, if a
 program is already using a disk, you cannot start the recover util- ity on
 that disk. Therefore, you cannot run recover on the disk from which you
 started MS OS/2. Nor can you run recover on the disk from which you started
 recover. If you need to run recover on the start-up disk, follow these
 steps:

   1.  Insert the MS OS/2 Install disk into drive A and turn on your
       computer. If your computer is already on, restart it by pressing
       CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   2.  At the first screen, press ESC. This takes you to the command prompt.

   3.  Insert the disk that contains the RECOVER

   4.  Start the recover utility. For example, if you want to run recover on
       the EMPLOYEE.TXT file located on drive C, type the following at the A
       prompt and press ENTER:

 recover c:\employee.txt





 If you need to run recover on the disk that contains the recover utility,
 you need to copy the RECOVERfloppy disk or hard disk) and run the utility
 from there.

 Recovering Extended Attributes

 When recovering a single file, the recover utility attempts to recover the
 extended attributes of the file. If it cannot recover the complete extended
 attribute information, what it can recover is stored in a file named
 EAnnnn.REC. (The letters nnnn designate a sequential number assigned by the
 operating system.) You can read this file by using the type command. The
 recovered file will no longer have extended attributes.

 When recovering an entire drive, all of the files lose their extended
 attributes. The recover utility stores the extended attributes in a file
 named FILEnnnn.REC. You can read this file by using the type command, but
 there is no way to tell which files the extended attributes originally
 belonged to.


 Specifying Device Information

 To specify or change the settings for a device in your system, use the mode
 utility. You can change settings for a parallel printer, a display device,
 or asynchronous communications devices such as modems and terminals.

 Before using devices that were set by using the mode utility, make sure that
 the proper device drivers and devices are installed. For more information
 about MS OS/2 device drivers, see Chapter 17, "Using MS OS/2 Device
 Drivers."

 For complete information about the options to the mode utility, see the
 Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference.


 Setting Operating Arguments for Devices


 The mode utility prepares MS OS/2 for communication with devices such as
 parallel and serial printers, modems, and screens.
 To use the mode utility, you must specify the name of the device you want to
 use followed by a list of arguments. MS OS/2 assigns names to devices as
 follows:

   ş   LPT1, LPT2, and LPT3 are parallel printers attached to the parallel
       ports of your computer. If you do not specify a port, LPT1 is the
       default device name. (PRN can be used in place of LPT1.)

   ş   COM1, COM2, and COM3 are serial devices that are attached to the
       serial communications ports of your computer. These could include
       devices such as modems or serial printers.


 Before you can set operating arguments for these devices, the device must be
 installed correctly and the appropriate device driver must be installed. For
 instructions on how to install device drivers, see Chapter 17, "Using MS
 OS/2 Device Drivers."

 Setting the Parallel-Printer Mode

 You can use the mode utility to set characteristics for parallel printers
 connected to parallel ports LPT1, LPT2, and LPT3. (PRN and LPT1 can be used
 interchangeably.) To set the operating arguments for a parallel port, you
 type mode followed by the following parallel-printer options:

 Option                            Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 lptn                              Specifies the printer number: 1, 2, or 3.

 chars                             Specifies the number of characters per
                                   line: 80 or 132. The default value is 80.

 lines                             Specifies vertical spacing (lines per
                                   inch): 6 or 8. The default value is 6.

 p                                 Specifies that the mode utility
                                   continues to send output to the printer
                                   even though a time-out error has
                                   occurred. A time-out error occurs when a
                                   printer cannot print your output in a
                                   previously specified amount of time. You
                                   can break out of this process at any
                                   time by pressing CTRL+C.

 You must set the lptn option; all other arguments are optional.

 For example, suppose that you want your computer to print to a parallel
 printer that is connected to your computer's second parallel-printer port
 (LPT2). If you want to print with 132 characters per line and 8 lines per
 inch, type the following:

 mode lpt2: 132,8




 Setting the Asynchronous Communication Mode

 You can use the mode utility to configure a specified serial port for
 communication with external devices such as printers, terminals, and modems.
 To display the status of a serial device, you type mode followed by the name
 of the asynchronous port. For example, to see the status of the device that
 is connected to COM2, type the following:

 mode com2


 To set the operating arguments for a serial port, you type mode followed by
 a combination of the following options:

 Option                            Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 comn                              Specifies the number of the asynchronous
                                   communications (COM) port. The range of
                                   valid values depends on your particular
                                   computer. For example, IBM PC/AT (and
                                   compatible) computers generally have two
                                   COM ports, while IBM PS/2 computers can
                                   have up to eight.

 baud                              Specifies the transmission rate. Valid
                                   rates are 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800,
                                   2400, 3600, 4800, 7200, 9600, and 19,200.
                                   (The 19,200 rate is valid for IBM PS/2
                                   computers [and compatible computers]
                                   only.) You can use just the first two
                                   digits to specify the transmission rate.

 parity                            Specifies the parity. Valid values are N
                                   (none), O (odd), E (even), M (mark; the
                                   parity equals 1), or S  ; the parity
                                   equals zero). The default value is E.

 databits                          Specifies the number of data bits. Valid
                                   values are 5, 6, 7, and 8. The default
                                   value is 7.

 stopbits                          Specifies the number of stop bits. Valid
                                   values are 1, 1.5, and 2. If the baud
                                   option is set to 110, the default value
                                   is 2; otherwise, the default value is 1.
                                   If you specify 1.5 stop bits, the
                                   databits option must be set to 5.

 You must set the baud option; all other arguments are optional.

 The options in the following list are used only when you use the mode
 utility in a full-screen session. These options may be listed in any order
 following the stopbits argument.

 Option                            Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 to=state                          Specifies whether infinite time-out
                                   processing is enabled (on) or whether
                                   normal time-out processing is used (off).
                                   The default setting is to=off.

 xon=state                         Specifies whether automatic
                                   transmit-flow control is enabled (on) or
                                   disabled (off). The default setting is
                                   xon=off.



 Option                            Purpose

 idsr=state                        Specifies whether the input handshake
                                   using DSR (data set ready) is enabled
                                   (on) or disabled (off). The default
                                   setting is idsr=on.

 odsr=state                        Specifies whether the output handshake
                                   using DSR (data set ready) is enabled
                                   (on) or disabled (off). The default
                                   setting is odsr=on.

 octs=state                        Specifies whether the output handshake
                                   using CTS (clear to send) is enabled (on)
                                   or disabled (off). The default setting

 dtr=state                         Specifies whether DTR (data terminal
                                   ready) is enabled (on) or disabled (off),
                                   or whether DTR handshaking is enabled
                                   (hs). The default setting is dtr=on.

 rts=state                         Specifies whether RTS (request to send)
                                   is enabled (on) or disabled (off),
                                   whether RTS handshaking is enabled (hs),
                                   or RTS toggling is enabled (tog). The
                                   default setting is rts=on.

 p                                 DOS session only. Specifies that the
                                   mode utility uses the COM port for a
                                   serial printer and that it continues to
                                   send output to the printer even when a
                                   time-out error occurs. A time-out error
                                   occurs when a printer cannot print your
                                   output in a previously specified amount
                                   of time. You can break out of this
                                   process at any time by pressing CTRL+C.

 buffer=on | off | auto            Specifies whether extended hardware
                                   buffering is enabled, disabled, or
                                   controlled automatically by the device
                                   driver. This option applies only to
                                   communications hardware or drivers that
                                   are capable of extended hardware
                                   buffering. For more information about
                                   this option, see the Microsoft Operating
                                   System/2 Command Reference.

 Suppose you wanted to use the mode utility to set up the COM2 serial
 communications port for 9600 baud, with even parity, 7 data bits, and 1 stop
 bit. To do this, you would type the following:

 mode com2: 9600


 In this example, the parity and number of data and stop bits were not
 specified, because the default values were used. If, on the other hand, you
 wanted to set up the COM2 port for 1200 baud, odd parity, 7 data bits, and 2
 stop bits, you would type the following:

 mode com2: 1200,o,,2


 The arguments you specify when you use the mode utility to set up your
 serial port must match the requirements of the device with which you want to
 communicate.


 Setting the Display Mode

 You can use the mode utility to select the active graphics adapter and
 its display mode or to change the way information is displayed on your
 screen.

 You can use the following options with the mode utility to set the display
 mode:

 Option                            Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 display                           Specifies one of the following values:
                                   40, 80, BW40, BW80, CO40, CO80, or MONO.
                                   For each of these values, 40 and 80
                                   indicate the number of characters per
                                   line. BW and CO refer to a color
                                   graphics adapter with color disabled (BW)
                                   or enabled (CO). MONO specifies a
                                   monochrome adapter with a constant
                                   display width of 80 characters per line.

 rows                              Specifies the number of rows of text
                                   displayed by the screen: 25, 43, 50, or
                                   60. The adapter type determines which of
                                   these values are valid. The initial
                                   value is 25; the default value is the
                                   last value that you set.

 When you type mode with the display argument, the utility affects the
 current session only. Suppose your computer uses an 80-character-per-line
 color graphics adapter (CO80). To change the number of rows of text
 displayed by the screen to 43, type the following:

 mode co80,43

 Introduction

 Before you use a hard disk, there are certain setup tasks that must be
 performed. These setup tasks may include any of the following:

   ş   Displaying partition data or logical-drive information

   ş   Creating or deleting a primary partition

   ş   Changing the start-up partition

   ş   Creating or deleting extended partitions and logical drives

   ş   Formatting the hard disk


 This chapter describes the tasks involved in setting up your hard disk and
 the tools you use to perform these setup tasks: Presentation Manager Fixed
 Disk Utility and the fdisk utility.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 All examples in this chapter are for the file allocation table (FAT) file
 system, which is the file system used by DOS and MS OS/2 versions 1.1 and
 earlier. For information on using the high-performance file system (HPFS),
 see Chapter 16, "Using the High-Performance File System."
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Starting and Quitting Fixed Disk Utility

 Fixed Disk Utility is a Presentation Manager application. You start it from
 the Desktop Manager Utilities group. To start Fixed Disk Utility, follow
 these steps:

   1.  Switch to Desktop Manager.

   2.  Open the Utilities-group window.

   3.  Choose Fixed Disk Utility.

       Fixed Disk Utility appears in a window on your screen, as shown in the
       following example.



 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 Specific examples are used throughout this chapter to illustrate how Fixed
 Disk Utility works. Your computer may display values different from those
 given in the examples, depending on the size and format of your hard disk.

 You can quit Fixed Disk Utility by using the Exit command from the Options
 menu. A dialog box asks if you want to save any changes. If you choose to
 save changes, another dialog box appears, telling you to restart your system
 by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. Changes take effect after you restart your system.
 To quit Fixed Disk Utility, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the Options menu and choose the Exit command.

       The Exit Fixed Disk Utility dialog box appears.

   2.  To save any changes, turn on the Save Changes check box.

   3.  Choose the Yes button.


 If you choose the No button in the dialog box, you return to Fixed Disk
 Utility. When you choose the Yes button, a dialog box appears, telling you
 to close all other running programs and then restart your computer by
 pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. At this point, you must either restart your system or
 choose the Help button for information about shutting down your system.


 Displaying Partition Data

 You can see how your hard disk is set up by using Fixed Disk Utility.

 (This figure may be found in the printed book).

 When you start Fixed Disk Utility, it creates a window that provides
 information about your hard disk. The Fixed Disk Utility window is divided
 into three sections: hard-disk icons, partition information, and
 logical-drive information.

   ş   You can display information for up to seven hard disks by using Fixed
       Disk Utility. Each hard disk is represented by a hard-disk icon, which
       is located at the top of the window. When you select a hard-disk icon,
       information about that disk is displayed.

   ş   You can organize your hard disk into separate sections called
       partitions. The primary partition is drive C; this is the location of
       the MS OS/2 start-up files. (The primary partition can contain data
       files and directories in addition to the start-up files.) PRI OS/2
       designates the primary partition in the Fixed Disk Utility window.

   ş   The extended partition is where logical drives are set up. Logical
       drives can contain data files and directories, but cannot contain MS
       OS/2 start-up files. EXT OS/2 designates the extended partition in the
       Fixed Disk Utility window. Having an extended partition on your hard
       disk is optional.

   ş   A partition's status is either startable or not startable. If the
       partition is startable, it contains the operating system's start-up
       files.

   ş   The size of the partition is displayed in megabytes.

   ş   The Percent of Disk entry indicates how much of the disk is formatted
       as the primary partition and how much of it is assigned to the
       extended partition and logical drives.

   ş   The Logical Drive entry gives the drive letter that MS OS/2 has
       assigned to each logical driveÄfor example, D, E, or F.

   ş   The Volume Label entry is the name that you give the disk when you
       format it.

   ş   The System entry indicates the file system with which the disk is
       formatted. If the type is IFS, for example, it means the partition is
       formatted with an installable file system.




 Creating and Deleting the Primary Partition

 MS OS/2 creates the primary partition during the installation process. Since
 the primary partition contains the MS OS/2 start-up files, and Presentation
 Manager cannot be started without them, you cannot create the primary
 partition on your start-up drive by using Fixed Disk Utility. You can,
 however, create a primary partition on another hard disk. To create a
 primary partition on a disk drive (other than the start-up drive), follow
 these steps:

   1.  Select the hard-disk icon for the disk you want to create a primary
       partition for.

   2.  Select the Options menu and the Create Primary Partition command. The
       Create Primary dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.  Press ENTER or choose the Create button to accept the default
       (maximum) value for the partition size, or type a smaller size and
       then choose the Create button. The maximum partition size is
       determined by the amount of space available on your hard disk.

   4.  A dialog box appears, reporting that the primary partition has been
       created. Choose the OK button.

   5.  To save your changes, select the Options menu, choose the Exit
       command, and follow the instructions on your screen.


 When a primary partition is created during the MS OS/2 installation process,
 you are asked to specify the size of the partition. By default, the
 installation program creates the primary partition using the maximum space
 available on the hard disk. Once the primary partition has been created, the
 only way to change its size is to delete it and then reinstall MS OS/2. The
 following section describes how to delete the primary partition.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 Be sure to make backup copies of all files before you delete the primary
 partition. When the primary partition is deleted, any extended partitions
 and logical drives are deleted as well, and all information contained on
 them is destroyed.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 To delete the primary and extended partitions, follow these steps:

   1.  Make sure that you have backup copies of all the files you want to
       save.

   2.  Insert the MS OS/2 Install disk into drive A and turn on your
       computer. If your computer is already on, restart it by pressing
       CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   3.  At the first screen, press the ESC key. This takes you to the command
       prompt for drive A.

   4.  Type the following at the prompt, and then press the ENTER key:

 fdisk /d




   5.  MS OS/2 displays a message that asks if you are sure you want to
       delete the primary partition. Press Y to proceed with the deletion.
       Press ENTER or N to stop without deleting the partition.




 Changing the Start-Up Partition

 The start-up partition is the partition from which your system starts; it
 contains the operating system's start-up files. If you have more than one
 operating system on your computer, you place each in a separate partition.
 Then, to use one of them, you make that partition the start-up partition.
 The primary partition on your C drive is, by default, the start-up
 partition. An extended partition cannot be a start-up partition unless it
 contains the start-up files for an operating system. To change the start-up
 partition, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the hard-disk icon for the disk that contains the partition you
       want to make the start-up partition.

   2.  Select the partition that you want to make the start-up partition from
       the Partition Information section of the Fixed Disk Utility window.

   3.  Select the Options menu and choose the Make Startable command.

   4.  A dialog box appears, telling you that the partition was made the
       start-up partition. Choose the OK button.

   5.  To save your changes, select the Options menu, choose the Exit
       command, and follow the instructions on your screen.




 Using an Extended Partition and Logical Drives

 Most users set up their entire hard disk as the primary partition, so they
 can gain access to any file or directory on the disk without having to
 change to a different logical drive. Some users, however, may need to set up
 and use an extended partition and logical drives. Several people sharing one
 computer, for example, could reserve the primary partition (drive C) for
 system files and shared data files and use logical drives D and E for the
 files of individual users. The following sections describe how to create and
 delete an extended partition and logical drives.


 Creating an Extended Partition

 You must create an extended partition before you can create logical drives.
 To create an extended partition, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the hard-disk icon for the disk on which you want to create an
       extended partition.

   2.  Select the Options menu and choose the Create Extended Partition
       command. The Create Extended dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.  Press ENTER or choose the Create button to accept the default
       (maximum) value for the partition size, or type a smaller size and
       then choose the Create button. The maximum partition size is
       determined by the amount of space available on your hard disk. .ET

   4.  A dialog box appears, reporting that an extended partition has been
       created. Choose the OK button.

   5.  To save your changes, select the Options menu, choose the Exit
       command, and follow the instructions on your screen.


 .RT


 Creating a Logical Drive

 After you have created an extended partition, you can create a logical
 drive. To create a logical drive, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the hard-disk icon for the disk on which you want to create a
       logical drive.

   2.  Select the Options menu and choose the Create Logical Drive command.
       The Create Logical dialog box appears.

       (This figure may be found in the printed book).

   3.  Press ENTER or choose the Create button to accept the default value
       for the size of the logical drive. You can type a smaller size if you
       would like to create more than one logical drive.

   4.  A dialog box appears, reporting that a logical drive has been created.
       Choose the OK button.

   5.  To save your changes, select the Options menu, choose the Exit
       command, and follow the instructions on your screen.


 When you quit Fixed Disk Utility after creating a logical drive, you should
 restart your system and then use the format utility to prepare the new
 logical drive for use. To do this, follow these steps:

   1.  Restart your system by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   2.  Choose OS/2 Full-Screen Command Prompt from the Main-group window.

   3.  At the command prompt, type the following and press ENTER:

 format drive:


       The drive argument is the letter assigned to the logical drive you
       just created. Repeat this step for every logical drive you created.


 The format utility, by default, formats a logical drive to use the file
 allocation table (FAT) file system. You can also format a logical drive to
 use the high-performance file system (HPFS). For more information, see
 Chapter 16, "Using the High-Performance File System."

 For complete information about using the format utility, see the Microsoft
 Operating System/2 Command Reference.


 Deleting a Logical Drive

 Before you can delete an extended partition, you must first delete any
 logical drives it contains. Remember that when you delete a logical drive,
 you lose any information stored there. To delete a logical drive, follow
 these steps:

   1.  Select the hard-disk icon for the disk that contains the logical drive
       to be deleted.

   2.  Select the logical drive to be deleted.

   3.  Select the Options menu and choose the Delete command.

   4.  A dialog box appears, asking if you are sure you want to delete the
       logical drive. Choose the Yes button to continue.

   5.  Another dialog box appears, reporting that the logical drive has been
       deleted. Choose the OK button.

   6.  To save your changes, select the Options menu, choose the Exit
       command, and follow the instructions on your screen.




 Deleting an Extended Partition

 To delete an extended partition, follow these steps:

   1.  Select the hard-disk icon for the disk that contains the extended
       partition to be deleted.

   2.  Make sure any logical drives in the extended partition have been
       deleted.

   3.  Select the extended partition to be deleted.

   4.  Select the Options menu and choose the Delete command.

   5.  A dialog box appears, asking if you are sure you want to delete the
       logical drive. Choose the Yes button to continue.

   6.  Another dialog box appears, reporting that the logical drive has been
       deleted. Choose the OK button.

   7.  To save your changes, select the Options menu, choose the Exit
       command, and follow the instructions on your screen.









 Chapter 14  Using Start-Up Files in MS OS/2
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Introduction

 Whenever you start or restart your system, MS OS/2 uses start-up files to
 get information about how to start your system. There are different start-up
 files for different parts of MS OS/2: AUTOEXEC.BAT provides information for
 the DOS session, STARTUP.CMD is for the full-screen and Presentation Manager
 sessions, and CONFIG.SYS provides information for the entire working
 environment. You can customize your MS OS/2 working environment by using
 these start-up files.

 This chapter briefly describes how to use the start-up files in MS OS/2.


 AUTOEXEC.BAT

 The AUTOEXEC.BAT batch
 file is used for customizing the DOS session in MS OS/2. You can use this
 file to change your DOS command prompt or to make MS OS/2 run certain
 commands automatically when you start the DOS session.

 The AUTOEXEC.BAT batch file is created during MS OS/2 installation, in the
 root directory of your start-up drive. It is run the first time you start
 the DOS session after starting or restarting your system.

 For more information about how to use AUTOEXEC.BAT and the DOS session, see
 Chapter 10, "Using the DOS Session."


 CONFIG.SYS

 The CONFIG.SYS file is an ASCII (text) file that contains start-up
 information. MS OS/2 reads this file when you start or restart your system.
 The protshell command in CONFIG.SYS specifies what user interface and
 initialization file to use, as well as which command interpreter to use in a
 full-screen session.

 A CONFIG.SYS file is created during MS OS/2 installation, and the following
 protshell command is placed there:

 protshell=c:\os2\pmshell.exe c:\os2\os2.ini c:\os2\cmd.exe


 This command specifies PMSHELL.EXE (Presentation Manager) as the user
 interface, OS2.INI as the initialization file, and cmd as the command
 interpreter to use in a full-screen session.


 OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI

 The OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI initialization files are binary files that
 contain information MS OS/2 uses when it starts Presentation Manager.
 OS2.INI contains information such as the program names, group names, and
 search paths used by Presentation Manager. For example, when you customize
 Desktop Manager or make changes through Control Panel, the new information
 is saved in the OS2.INI file. The file OS2SYS.INI contains information used
 by Print Manager. If something happens to either your OS2.INI or OS2SYS.INI
 file, you will need to replace it with a new one. To create a new OS2.INI or
 OS2SYS.INI file by using the makeini utility, follow these steps:

   1.  Insert the MS OS/2 Install Disk into drive A and turn on your
       computer. If your computer is already on, restart it by pressing
       CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   2.  At the first screen, press the ESC key. This takes you to the command
       prompt.

   3.  To create a new OS2.INI file, type the following and press the ENTER
       key:

       c:\os2\makeini os2.ini ini.rc

   4.  To create a new OS2SYS.INI file, type the following and press the
       ENTER key:

       c:\os2\makeini os2sys.ini inisys.rc

   5.  Remove the MS OS/2 Install disk from drive A and restart your computer
       by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.


 For information about cmd, the MS OS/2 command interpreter, see Chapter 8,
 "Running Cmd."

 The CONFIG.SYS file contains other commands that customize your system. For
 a list of the contents of CONFIG.SYS and for information about how to use
 configuration commands, see Chapter 15, "Using MS OS/2 Configuration
 Commands."


 Other Start-Up Files

 The CONFIG.SYS file is the primary start-up file for the OS/2 and DOS
 sessions. Although CONFIG.SYS is usually the only start-up file you will
 need, you can create other start-up files to further customize the cmd
 working environment. There are two cmd start-up files you can create, both
 of which are batch programs:

   ş   The STARTUP.CMD batch program, which initializes the first cmd
       session.

   ş   A separate batch program, which initializes all subsequent cmd
       sessions.


 Both types of batch programs are described in the following sections.


 Calling STARTUP.CMD

 When you start or restart your system, MS OS/2 searches for the STARTUP.CMD
 file in the root directory of the start-up drive. If found, STARTUP.CMD
 automatically creates the first cmd session. As in other batch files, you
 can place batch commands, cmd commands, utilities, and programs in the
 STARTUP.CMD file.

 Remember that STARTUP.CMD is run only when you start or restart your
 computer, and therefore customizes only the first cmd session. To customize
 additional cmd sessions, you must create a separate batch program.


 Calling a Batch Program from Cmd

 To run a specified batch program whenever you start cmd, you add the /k
 option, followed by the name of the batch program, to the protshell
 configuration command in the CONFIG.SYS file.

 For example, suppose that whenever you run cmd you want your command prompt
 to appear in a special, customized form. First you create a batch file that
 contains the command that sets your prompt to the way you want it to appear,
 and then you specify the name of that batch file on the protshell command
 line in the CONFIG.SYS file.

 If the batch file in this example were named OS2INIT.CMD, you would add the
 following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 protshell=c:\os2\pmshell.exe c:\os2\os2.ini c:\os2\os2sys.ini
 c:\os2\cmd.exe /k c:\os2init.cmd


 (This should all be typed on one line, even though it appears as two lines
 here.) In this example, the OS2INIT.CMD batch program runs whenever cmd is
 started. OS2INIT.CMD can contain any combination of batch-program commands.
 For more information about the protshell command, see Chapter 15, "Using MS
 OS/2 Configuration Commands."

 When you start MS OS/2, your system reads configuration commands from the
 CONFIG.SYS file on your start-up disk. These commands give information to
 the operating system about the setup, or configuration, of your particular
 system. This chapter gives the form of the MS OS/2 configuration commands
 and examples of how they might be used. Even though most users will never
 need to change their CONFIG.SYS file, changes can be made, if necessary, by
 referring to the information in this chapter. For more information about the
 individual configuration commands, see the Microsoft Operating System/2
 Command Reference.

 During installation, MS OS/2 creates the CONFIG.SYS file; you can view the
 default values assigned to some of the configuration commands and modify
 some of those values at this time. Once the installation is complete, you
 can change command values, either by running the installation program again
 or by using System Editor or another text editor to edit your CONFIG.SYS
 file. If MS OS/2 detects an error in the CONFIG.SYS file, it displays an
 error message and pauses until you press the ENTER key. If you do not want
 MS OS/2 to pause after displaying a CONFIG.SYS error message, add the
 following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 pauseonerror=no


 When you add this command, MS OS/2 still displays the error message, but it
 does not pause before processing the CONFIG.SYS file.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 All examples of filenames and directory names in this chapter use the file
 allocation table (FAT) file system, which is the file system used by DOS and
 MS OS/2 versions 1.1 and earlier. For information on using high-performance
 file system (HPFS) filenames and directory names, see Chapter 16, "Using the
 High-Performance File System."

 Defining the CONFIG.SYS File

 In order to run MS OS/2, certain configuration commands are required in your
 CONFIG.SYS file. During installation, MS OS/2 adds these required commands
 to your CONFIG.SYS file. The following list shows you what the CONFIG.SYS
 file might look like after MS OS/2 is installed:

 protshell=c:\os2\pmshell.exe c:\os2\os2.ini c:\os2\os2sys.ini
  c:\os2\cmd.exe
 set comspec=c:\os2\cmd.exe
 libpath=c:\os2\dll;c:\;
 set path=c:\os2;c:\os2\system;c:\os2\install;c:\;
 set dpath=c:\os2;c:\os2\system;c:\os2\install;c:\;
 set prompt=$i[$p]

                                   run.

 memman                            Specifies whether memory swapping and

                                   kilobytes).

 threads                           Specifies the maximum number of threads
                                   that can be used at one time.

 shell                             Specifies the DOS command interpreter,
                                   command; used in the DOS session.

 break                             Determines when MS OS/2 checks for the

 rmsize                            Determines the amount of memory reserved
                                   for DOS (real-mode) applications; used
                                   in the DOS session.

 device                            Sets up a device driver.



 Modifying Values of Configuration Commands

 You can use your favorite text editor to modify the CONFIG.SYS file. Changes
 take effect when you restart your system. Before you make changes to the
 CONFIG.SYS file, you should first make a backup copy of the file. The backup
 copy of the CONFIG.SYS file is useful if you make a change that causes an
 error and prevents your system from starting correctly. If such an error
 occurs, follow these steps to start your system:

   1.  Insert the MS OS/2 Install disk into drive A and turn on your
       computer. If your computer is already on, restart it by pressing
       CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   2.  At the first screen, press the ESC key. This takes you to the command
       prompt.

   3.  Copy your backup copy of the configuration file to the root directory
       of the start-up drive. The copy you put on the start-up drive must be
       named CONFIG.SYS.

   4.  Remove the MS OS/2 Install disk from drive A and restart your computer
       by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.


 It is important to note that most users will never need to change the values
 in the CONFIG.SYS file and that it is recommended that you not do so. If you
 need to change the CONFIG.SYS file, however, the information provided in
 this chapter should help you to understand how the configuration commands
 work.


 Setting Up the Presentation Manager Session

 This section describes the configuration commands that set up the
 Presentation Manager session. You use these commands to set up the MS OS/2
 user interface and to specify the location of dynamic-link libraries. The
 following commands are described:

   ş   libpath

   ş   protshell

   ş   iopl




 Specifying the Location of .DLL Files


 MS OS/2 finds dynamic-link library modules by using the libpath
 onfiguration command. Dynamic-link libraries contain functionally related
 portions of MS OS/2. The filenames of dynamic-link libraries usually end
 with the extension .DLL; for example, a library named DISPLAY.DLL contains
 an MS OS/2 display driver. Presentation Manager printer drivers, fonts, and
 queue processors are also dynamic-link libraries; these filenames usually
 end with the .DRV, Suppose, for example, that you have a new dynamic-link
 library that you have put into the LIB directory on drive C. For MS OS/2 to
 be able to use the new dynamic-link library, the LIB directory must be part
 of the libpath command in your CONFIG.SYS file. The libpath command would
 appear as follows:
 libpath=c:\os2\dll;c:\;c:\lib


 This example directs MS OS/2 to look for dynamic-link libraries in the
 C:\OS2\DLL directory, the root directory, and the C:\LIB directory on your
 hard disk.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 There are differences between the libpath command and the set path command.
 The libpath command is a configuration command that specifies the location
 of each of the directories containing .DLL files. The set path command sets
 the value of the PATH environment variable and specifies a directory search
 path. Also, with the libpath command, the current directory is not searched
 first, as it is with set path.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Changing the User Interface

 You use the protshell configuration command to specify the user interface
 (the protected-mode shell) and the MS OS/2 command interpreter. The user
 interface is the program you see when you start your system.

 During installation, MS OS/2 places the following protshell command in your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 protshell=c:\os2\pmshell.exe c:\os2\os2.ini c:\os2\cmd.exe


 In this example, the user interface is PMSHELL.EXE, the Presentation Manager
 shell. For more information about this command, see Chapter 14, "Using
 Start-Up Files in MS OS/2."


 Specifying the Presentation Manager Device Driver

 When you specify the Presentation Manager shell, you must also specify the
 Presentation Manager device driver. The device=c:\os2\pmdd.sys command
 specifies this device driver; this command is placed in your CONFIG.SYS file
 during the installation of MS OS/2. If, for some reason, this command does
 not exist in your CONFIG.SYS file, you will not be able to start
 Presentation Manager. You can add the command by following these steps:

   1.  Insert the MS OS/2 Install disk into drive A and turn on your
       computer. If your computer is already on, restart it by pressing
       CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   2.  At the first screen, press ESC. This takes you to the command prompt.

   3.  Using a text editor, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\pmdd.sys




   4.  Remove the MS OS/2 Install disk from drive A and restart your computer
       by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.




 Enabling Input and Output Privilege Levels

 You enable or disable input and output privilege levels by using the iopl
 configuration command.

 The privilege level assigned to a program determines which data segments it
 can access and which machine instructions it can execute. Applications are
 usually assigned privilege level 3, which allows them to refer only to their
 own data segments and restricts them from issuing input/output instructions.


 Applications that are assigned privilege level 2 can refer to the data
 segments of other applications and issue input/output instructions. When you
 specify iopl=yes, a program that has been assigned privi- lege level 2 is
 allowed to send or receive the machine instructions necessary to access a
 particular input/output device. You can also specify input/output privilege
 levels for programs on an individual basis. For example, to grant a printer
 driver named Newprint access to a particular piece of hardware, add the
 following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 iopl=newprint.drv


 The iopl command does not affect programs that run in the DOS session.

 It is not necessary for you to specify iopl=no, since no is the default
 value.


 Setting Up the DOS Session

 This section describes the configuration commands that customize the DOS
 session. In most cases, the default initialization values should not be
 changed. You will need to modify these values only when you want to create a
 customized work environment or when an application requires you to do so.

 You can further customize the DOS session by adding commands to your
 AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For information on this file, see Chapter 10, "Using the
 DOS Session."


 Enabling the DOS Session

 By default, the DOS session is enabled whenever you start MS OS/2. This is
 controlled by the protectonly configuration command in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 The following rules apply to setting up the DOS session:

   ş   If you specify protectonly=no, the DOS session can be started. If you
       do not place a protectonly command in your CONFIG.SYS file, MS OS/2
       enables the DOS session.

   ş   If you specify protectonly=no, the following line must also appear in
       the CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\dos.sys




   ş   If you specify protectonly=yes, the DOS session cannot be started.




 Configuring the DOS Session

 While most of the configuration commands apply to all of the sessions in MS
 OS/2, the following configuration commands are specific to the DOS session:

   ş   shell

   ş   rmsize

   ş   break

   ş   fcbs


 These commands are described in the following sections.

 Specifying the DOS Command Interpreter

 To specify the DOS command interpreter, use the shell configuration command.
 The shell configuration command lets you specify the command interpreter
 that is loaded and run in the DOS session.

 The default shell for the DOS session is command. This means that if you do
 not include a shell configuration command in the CONFIG.SYS file, MS OS/2
 searches for COMMANDof your start-up disk and loads it into memory. If you
 specify another DOS shell to use, MS OS/2 will search for that shell program
 and load it into memory. The chances are that you will need to use the shell
 command only if the COMMANDexample, suppose that COMMANDdirectory of your
 start-up drive (drive C). In this case, you would place the following line
 in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 shell=c:\os2\command.com c:\os2 /p /e:512


 This example directs MS OS/2 to load command from the OS2 directory instead
 of from the root directory of drive C.

 Another reason for using the shell configuration command is to spec- ify
 options to the DOS-session command interpreter. Command has options that let
 you permanently keep a copy of COMMANDin memory, run a command or program,
 or specify the size of the command interpreter's environment.

 For information about command and its options, see the Microsoft Operating
 System/2 Command Reference.

 Allocating Memory for DOS Applications


 To set the amount of memory reserved for DOS applications, use the rmsize
 configuration command. Up to 640K can be reserved. You need to specify at
 least 256K to be able to create a DOS session.
 The default size depends on the total memory installed in your computer; it
 is the amount of memory installed below 1024K (either 512K or 640K). To use
 this command, you type rmsize= followed by the number of kilobytes of memory
 you want to reserve for DOS applications. For example, to reserve 640K for
 use by programs running in the DOS session, add the following line to your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 rmsize=


 Remember that some of the total memory is reserved for MS OS/2 itself. For
 more information about memory usage with the rmsize command, see the
 Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference.

 Setting CTRL+C Checking

 Normally, MS OS/2 checks whether you have pressed CTRL+C only while it is
 reading from your keyboard or sending something to your screen or printer.
 However, you can enable additional CTRL+C check- ing by using the break
 configuration command. When you specify break=on, MS OS/2 checks whether
 CTRL+C has been pressed whenever it is reading from or writing to a disk.
 For example, if you want to stop a file from being sorted and you have set
 break=on in your CONFIG.SYS file, you can press CTRL+C to stop the sorting
 process. To enable additional CTRL+C checking, add the following line to
 your CONFIG.SYS file:

 break=on




 Specifying the Number of Open File-Control Blocks (FCBs)

 To specify the number of open file-control blocks (FCBs), use the fcbs
 configuration command.

 Although it is recommended that new programs use file handles to access
 files, some older DOS applications use data structures called file-control
 blocks (FCBs) to control opened files. If your application uses FCBs, you
 can use the fcbs configuration command to specify the maximum number of
 files controlled by FCBs that can be opened concurrently. The command also
 specifies the number of files opened with FCBs that are protected against
 automatic closure.

 By default, up to 16 FCB files can be opened concurrently, and all but 8
 files can be automatically closed. You should use the fcbs command to change
 these values only if your application requires you to do so. To use this
 command, you type fcbs= followed by the total number of FCBs that can be
 opened concurrently (1 through 255) and the total number of files that
 cannot be closed automatically (zero through 255).

 For example, to open as many as four files with FCBs and protect the first
 two files from being closed automatically, add the following line to your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 fcbs=,2


 The number of files that are protected from closure must be less than or
 equal to the total number of open files.


 Modifying Multitasking Features

 MS OS/2 provides several configuration commands that let you modify its
 multitasking features. Although most users will not need to use these
 commands, there may be times when you are advised to change these features
 to enhance how an application runs with MS OS/2. The following commands let
 you modify the multitasking features of MS OS/2:

   ş   threads

   ş   maxwait

   ş   priority

   ş   timeslice


 These commands are described in the following sections.


 Specifying the Maximum Number of Threads

 To specify the maximum number of threads that you can create at one time,
 use the threads configuration command.

 MS OS/2 allocates at least one thread for every running program. A program
 may request additional threads if it needs them to perform tasks
 simultaneously.

 The threads configuration command sets a system-wide limit on the number of
 threads that can be created. During installation, MS OS/2 sets the number of
 threads to 128. About 35 threads are used by MS OS/2; the remaining threads
 are available for use by other programs. If you will be running many
 programs that use a large number of threads, you may want to use the threads
 configuration command to increase the number of threads that can be created
 at one time. To use this command, you type threads= followed by the maximum
 number of threads you want to create at one time. You can specify any value
 from 64 through 512.

 For example, to increase the number of threads from 128 (the default value)
 to 255, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 threads=


 Be aware that as the number of threads is increased, a small amount of
 memory is used up.


 Specifying the Maximum Time a Process Waits

 In a multitasking environment, each process that runs is assigned a priority
 level that determines how often the process can run. If a process has a high
 priority, it is granted permission to run more often than a process with a
 low priority. Thus, a low-priority process might wait a long time before it
 is allowed to run. You can change the amount of time a process must wait by
 using the maxwait configuration command.

 The maxwait command specifies the maximum amount of time any active process
 must wait before it runs. If the specified time elapses, the priority of the
 waiting process is increased for one execution cycle (also called a time
 slice). To use the maxwait command, you type maxwait= followed by the number
 of seconds a process must wait before receiving a priority increase. You can
 specify any value from 1 through 255 seconds. The default value is 3
 seconds.

 For example, suppose that you want to make background programs, which
 normally have low priority, run faster. You could specify that you want a
 process to wait only 1 second before receiving a priority increase, by
 placing the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 maxwait=


 Note that this will increase the speed of low-priority processes (such as
 background programs), but that it will also decrease the speed of
 high-priority processes (such as foreground programs).


 Disabling Dynamic Priority Assignments

 In MS OS/2, processes (threads) are divided into three categories according
 to their priority: general, time-critical, and low. The general-priority
 category is further divided into foreground, background, and interactive
 subcategories. MS OS/2 can automatically adjust the priority levels of
 general-priority processes as circumstances change (for example, when a
 foreground process becomes a background process), thus causing the process
 to run more often or less often. This feature is known as dynamic priority
 scheduling.

 By default, MS OS/2 allows dynamic priority scheduling; however, you can
 turn this feature off (or turn it back on) by using the priority
 configuration command. To disable dynamic priority processing and instead
 allocate CPU time to the processes according to the priorities they are
 currently assigned, you would type the following:

 priority=absolute


 By default, the priority command
 is set to dynamic. Unless you are specifically advised to do so, it should
 not be necessary to change this setting. This command interacts with the
 maxwait command described earlier: the priority command must be set to
 dynamic for the maxwait command to have an effect on system performance.


 Setting the Time-Slice Values

 To specify the minimum and maximum amount of time that MS OS/2 will dedicate
 to a given process before it checks on other processes that may be waiting,
 use the timeslice configuration command. A time slice is an interval of time
 used by MS OS/2 to schedule the threads of a process. To use this command,
 you type timeslice= followed by the minimum and, optionally, the maximum
 time-slice value (in milliseconds). If you specify only the minimum
 time-slice value, the maximum time slice is also set to that value.

 For example, if you run an application that advises you to change the
 minimum time-slice value to 64 milliseconds, add the following line to your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 timeslice=


 If you add this line, MS OS/2 will let at least 64 milliseconds pass before
 it switches to another program.

 For applications that take up a large amount of processing time, a larger
 time-slice setting is better. For applications that do not work if they are
 interrupted for long periods of time, such as telecommunications
 applications, a smaller time-slice setting is better.


 Managing System Memory

 The following MS OS/2 configuration commands help your system manage memory
 efficiently:

   ş   diskcache

   ş   memman

   ş   swappath

   ş   buffers




 These commands are described in the following sections.


 Setting Up a Disk Cache

 You can enable disk caching and specify the number of kilobytes of memory
 allocated for the disk cache by using the diskcache configuration command.
 Since reading from a disk cache in memory takes less time than reading from
 storage, using a disk cache makes your system-response time much faster.
 When disk caching is enabled and a program instructs the system to read from
 your hard disk, the system stores what it reads in the disk cache in memory.
 When the program instructs the system to read from the hard disk again, the
 system checks the cache for the data, and reads from the hard drive only if
 the data is not in the cache. To allocate a 128K disk cache in your system,
 add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 diskcache=


 If there is no diskcache command in your CONFIG.SYS file, MS OS/2 does not
 enable disk caching, and no cache space is allocated.

 You should not use the diskcache configuration command if your system has a
 partition that uses the high-performance file system (HPFS), because it
 slows the performance of HPFS.


 Enabling Memory Swapping and Moving

 You can use the memman configuration command to enable or disable the
 memory-management techniques of swapping and moving.

 Swapping is a technique by which some segments in memory are written to a
 file on a disk, making the memory these segments were using available for
 another purpose. The swapped segment is reloaded into memory when it is
 needed. You can swap memory segments from the DOS session by using the
 swapdos option.

 Moving is a technique by which MS OS/2 can combine unused blocks of storage
 into larger areas, which can then be used by a program or application.
 Suppose you are running a telecommunications program that loses its
 connection if it cannot respond to incoming data within a specified amount
 of time. To prevent MS OS/2 from swapping segments of the program out to the
 hard disk (and possibly preventing a timely response), add the following
 line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 memman=noswap


 You can use the memman command in several forms, including the following:

 memman=swapdos
 memman=swap,move,noswapdos
 memman=noswap,nomove
 memman=swap
 memman=swap,move
 memman=noswap
 memman=noswap,move


 If you specify the swapdos option, swap and move are the default
 assignments. If you specify only the swap or noswap option, move is the
 default assignment.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 MS OS/2 may not swap the DOS session in the following situations:
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


   ş   If you use the mode utility to configure a serial port

   ş   If you switch to another session while a DOS program is reading from
       or writing to a file





 Using a Disk-Swap File

 You can specify the location of the disk-swap file by using the swappath
 configuration command. A disk-swap file is a file that keeps track of code
 or data that is temporarily moved out of mem- ory while another programs
 runs. The swappath command is used in conjunction with the memman command.
 Suppose, for example, that you want MS OS/2 to write the swap file to the
 SWAPFILE directory on your hard disk (drive C). To do this, add the
 following lines to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 memman=swap,move
 swappath=c:\swapfile


 If the swappath command is not specified in your CONFIG.SYS file, MS OS/2
 writes the disk-swap file to the root directory of the drive from which your
 system starts.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you are using the swappath command, make sure your sys- tem has ample
 space available. The minimum size of a disk-swap file is 512K.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Changing the Number of Disk Buffers

 You can change the number of disk buffers (work areas in memory) by using
 the buffers configuration command. MS OS/2 uses disk buffers as temporary
 work space while reading and writing data when you use the file allocation
 table (FAT) file system. Suppose that you want to change the number of
 buffers to 15. To do this, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 buffers=


 Each disk buffer is a 512-byte block of memory. You can specify from 1
 through 100 buffers. During installation, the value of the buffers command
 is set to 30. If you remove the buffers command from your CONFIG.SYS file,
 the default value is 3.


 Setting Up a Device Driver

 You can set up a device driver by using the device configuration command. A
 device driver is a program that allows MS OS/2 to use devices in your
 system. These devices may include the keyboard, monitor, disk drives, and
 system clock, and pointing devices such as a mouse. For example, if you are
 using the serial version of the Microsoft Mouse with Presentation Manager on
 an IBM PC/AT (or a compatible computer), your CONFIG.SYS file should contain
 the following device commands:

 device=c:\os2\epointdd.sys
 device=c:\os2\msser01.sys model=
 device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msser$


 This example directs MS OS/2 to look for the pointer and mouse drivers. When
 MS OS/2 loads these drivers, MS OS/2 and DOS programs can use the mouse.

 For more information about MS OS/2 device drivers, see Chapter 17, "Using MS
 OS/2 Device Drivers."


 Setting Up Your Environment

 One of the steps in setting up your system environment is defining the way
 you want your system to perform. This section describes how to set
 environment variables and how to run programs that set up your system.

 Environment variables are ASCII strings that can be assigned values of your
 choice. The set of these strings is known as the environment. A small part
 of memory is reserved for storing environment variables. When a value is
 stored as an environment variable, it can be used by any program in the
 session.


 Setting Environment Variables

 To assign a value to an environment variable,
 use the set configuration command. To use this command, specify the
 environment-variable name followed by the value that will be assigned to it.


 Environment variables commonly set in your CONFIG.SYS file include PATH
 (directory search path) and DPATH (data search path). Programmers will often
 set the LIB (library search path), INCLUDE (include-file search path), and
 TMP (temporary-file search path) environment variables in their CONFIG.SYS
 file. You can also define and set your own environment variables. For
 example, to set the PATH environment variable so that MS OS/2 searches the
 current directory first (the default setting), the BIN directory on drive C
 second, and the OS2 directory on drive C third, add the following line to
 your CONFIG.SYS file:

 set path=c:\ebin;c:\eos2


 You can turn on the MS OS/2 command-line editing feature by setting an
 environment variable. To do this, place the following line in your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 set keys=on


 For information about how to use the keys command, see Chapter 8, "Running
 Cmd."

 Inheriting Environment Variables

 Normally, environment variables such as PATH and DPATH are set up in your
 CONFIG.SYS file. The first time the MS OS/2 command interpreter (cmd) is
 run, these environment variables are used to set up the initial working
 environment.

 When you start cmd from Desktop Manager, the new session inherits the
 environment variables found in the CONFIG.SYS file. If you start cmd from an
 existing session, however, the new version of cmd inherits the environment
 variables of the current session. If you have modified any environment
 variables, the current environment may not be the same as the environment
 that is specified in the CONFIG.SYS file.


 Starting a Program When You Start Your System

 By using configuration commands, you can have MS OS/2 start programs when
 you start or restart your system. Whether you run a program as a foreground
 or a background program depends on whether the program needs to receive
 input. A program that needs to receive input from the keyboard or mouse must
 run as a foreground program.


 Starting a Program as a Foreground Program

 You use the call configuration command to specify an MS OS/2 program that
 you want to be started as a foreground program whenever you start or restart
 your system. You can specify any program that you can start from cmd. For
 example, you can use the call configuration command to start a program that
 makes a network connection each time you start your system. (This kind of
 program should run as a foreground program, because you will need to type
 your password.) To start a program called Connect, located in the NETWORK
 directory of drive C, you would add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS
 file:

 call=c:\network\connect.exe


 If the program you want to start requires arguments, simply type the
 arguments after the program name.

 Starting a Program as a Background Program

 You use the run configuration command to specify a program that you want to
 be started as a background program when you start or restart your system.
 Suppose that you want to start a keyboard speed-up program called Fastype
 each time you start MS OS/2. If this program is located in the root
 directory of drive C, you would add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS
 file:

 run=c:\fastype.exe


 Keep the following points in mind when you use the call and run
 configuration commands:

   ş   You can specify multiple call and run commands in your CONFIG.SYS
       file.

   ş   You cannot specify a batch program with either the call or run
       command.

   ş   MS OS/2 processes call and run commands in the order in which they
       appear in the CONFIG.SYS file.

   ş   MS OS/2 processes all device commands before processing call and run
       commands.

   ş   Programs specified by the call and run commands are started before the
       user interface is initialized.




 Setting Up Code-Page Support


 MS OS/2 provides national-language support through the use of code pages. A
 code page is a set of 256 characters that MS OS/2 recognizes and processes.
 MS OS/2 currently supports four code pages: United States (437),
 Multilingual (850), Portuguese (860), and Canadian French (863). New
 programs, including Presentation Manager, use the multilingual code page. If
 you have a program that uses a different code page, you will need to set up
 the code page during installation or by modifying your CONFIG.SYS file.
 You can set up one code page for a single country, or you can set up two
 code pages to enable code-page switching. If you set up two code pages, you
 can use the chcp command to switch between them. This command is described
 in Chapter 8, "Running Cmd." You can also switch between the keyboard
 layouts of two different countries by using the keyb utility. This utility
 is described in Chapter 9, "Using MS OS/2 Utilities."

 If you are using the United States version of MS OS/2, the correct code-page
 information is set up automatically during installation. If, however, you
 want your keyboard, screen, and printer to be customized to support
 characters and keyboard layouts for countries other than the United States,
 you must modify the default code-page information.

 Normally, you modify code-page information during installation. On-screen
 messages prompt you for the country you want to support. The information you
 supply is written to your CONFIG.SYS file. If you want to change code-page
 information after installing MS OS/2, follow the instructions in this
 section to modify your CONFIG.SYS file.

 To set up code-page support for a country other than the United States, you
 must do the following:

   ş   Set the country code for the country for which you want code-page
       support by using the country configuration command.

   ş   Prepare the code page(s) for the system by using the codepage
       configuration command.

   ş   Prepare devices for use with the code page(s) you have prepared, by
       using the devinfo configuration command.


 The following sections describe how to use each of these commands in your
 CONFIG.SYS file.

 After you have specified the country code and code page(s) to be used, and
 after you have prepared devices for use with code pages, restart your
 computer. When you restart your computer, MS OS/2 reads the information in
 your CONFIG.SYS file and loads the proper code page(s) in memory.


 Supported Countries


 The following list shows each country (or group of countries) that is
 supported by MS OS/2, and its related country code, default code-page
 assignment (assigned during the installation of MS OS/2, when you choose the
 country), keyboard code, and keyboard subcode. The primary code page is
 listed first, followed by the secondary code page. You use the values in
 this list when you add the country, codepage, and devinfo configuration
 commands to your CONFIG.SYS file, and when you use the keyb utility.

 Note

 Although they are not shown in the list, the following code pages are
 available with special versions of MS OS/2: Arabic, Asia, Hebrew, Japan,
 Korea, People's Republic of China, and Taiwan.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Setting the Country Code


 To define country-dependent information such as time, date, and
 urrency conventions, use the country configuration command. To use this
 command, you type country= followed by the country code. If your COUNTRY.SYS
 file is not in the root directory of your start-up drive, you type the
 drive, directory path, and filename after the country code.
 For example, if your COUNTRY.SYS file is in the OS2 directory on drive C,
 you would type the following to specify the country code for France:

 country=,c:\os2\country.sys


 The country code 033 sets country-specific information for France.


 Preparing Code Pages

 To select the code page(s) that will be prepared for use, use the codepage
 configuration command. To use this command, you type codepage= followed by
 one or two code-page numbers. (If you are preparing two code pages, separate
 the two numbers with a comma.)

 Valid code-page numbers are as follows:

 Number                            Code page
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 437                               United States

 850                               Multilingual

 860                               Portuguese

 863                               Canadian French

 For example, to prepare code pages 437 (United States) and 850
 (Multilingual), type the following:

 codepage=,850


 If you prepare two code pages, you can use the chcp command to switch back
 and forth between the two character sets. See the Microsoft Operating
 System/2 Command Reference for the charac- ter sets for code pages 437, 850,
 860, and 863.


 Preparing Devices for Use with Code Pages


 To prepare your keyboard, screen, and printer so that they can use the code
 pages that you specified with the codepage configuration command, use the
 devinfo configuration command. If you want to be able to switch code pages,
 one devinfo command is required for each device you prepare. The devinfo
 command for your keyboard specifies your keyboard layout and the file that
 contains the keyboard-translation tables. To set up your keyboard for use
 with code pages, you type devinfo=kbd followed by a keyboard code and the
 drive, directory path, and name of the file containing the
 keyboard-translation table. By default, MS OS/2 supplies
 keyboard-translation tables in a file called KEYBOARD.DCP.
 For example, to prepare a French keyboard for use with code pages, place the
 following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 devinfo=kbd,fr,c:\os2\keyboard.dcp


 .ET The devinfo command for your screen specifies the type of screen (either
 EGA or VGA) and the file that contains a video-font table for displaying
 characters in each of the supported code pages. To set up your screen for
 use with code pages, you type devinfo=scr followed by the type of graphics
 adapter you have and the drive, directory path, and name of the file that
 contains the system code pages for the screen. The file VIOTBL.DCP contains
 the screen-translation table.

 For example, to prepare an EGA display for use with code pages, place the
 following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 devinfo=scr,ega,c:\os2\viotbl.dcp


 The devinfo command for your printer specifies the printer type, the printer
 name, and the file that contains a printer-font table for each code page
 supported by MS OS/2. To set up your printer for use with code pages, you
 type devinfo= followed by the port name, the printer name, and the drive,
 directory path, and name of the file that contains the printer-font tables.

 For example, to prepare an IBM 4201 printer that is connected to the LPT1
 printer port for use with code pages, you would add the following line to
 your CONFIG.SYS file:

 devinfo=lpt1,4201,c:\os2\4201.dcp


 If your computer includes code-page information in read-only memory (ROM),
 specify the code page and font-identification number for each .RT ROM or
 printer cartridge by using the ROM specification after the name of the file
 containing the printer-font table. If you do not specify multiple fonts or
 font-identification numbers, the devinfo command uses zero as the
 font-identification number.

 For example, to prepare an IBM 4201 printer that is connected to printer
 port LPT1 for use with code page 437 that is contained in ROM, add the
 following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 devinfo=lpt1,4201,c:\os2\4201.dcp,rom=(437,0)


 Remember that you must have one devinfo command for each device on your
 system if you want to be able to switch code pages.


 Controlling System Tracing

 The system trace is a record of actions, such as hardware interrupts or
 functions, that are taken or processed by the operating system while it
 runs. Recording these events can be helpful in developing programs for MS
 OS/2. There are two configuration commands that control system tracing:
 tracebuf and trace. (There are also two utilities you can use to control
 system tracing: trace and tracefmt. For information about these utilities,
 see the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference.)


 Setting the Size of the System-Trace Buffer

 To set the size of the system-trace buffer, you place a tracebuf command in
 your CONFIG.SYS file. The system-trace buffer is where system-trace events
 are stored. If you enable tracing but do not specify the size of the trace
 buffer, a 4K buffer is automatically set up for you. To use the tracebuf
 command, type tracebuf= followed by the size of the trace buffer (in
 kilobytes). The size can be from 1 through 63K. For example, to set up a
 trace buffer of 8K, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 tracebuf=


 A trace buffer of between 4 and 8K is enough for most trace activities.


 Turning Tracing On or Off

 To turn tracing on or off for some or all events, you use the trace
 configuration command. To use this command, you should specify an event code
 that corresponds to a type of system activity, such as file-system events.
 The event code must be a decimal number from zero through 255. To turn
 tracing on, type trace=on followed by one or more event codes. Typing
 trace=on without an event code records all system-trace events. To turn
 tracing off, type trace=off followed by one or more event codes. Typing
 trace=off without an event code cancels the recording of all system-trace
 events.

 You can turn tracing on for specified event codes. For example, to turn on
 only the system-trace events zero and 1, add the following lines to your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 trace=off
 trace=on 0, 1


 You can also selectively turn tracing off for certain events. If you want to
 turn tracing on for all events except 31 through 34, add the following lines
 to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 trace=on
 trace=off 31, 32, 33, 34


 You can use the tracefmt utility to view trace-event records. For more
 information about using tracefmt, see the Microsoft Operating System/2
 Command Reference.

 Introduction

 A new feature of MS OS/2 is the capability for multiple file systems to
 exist under one operating system. The original file allocation table (FAT)
 file system is still present, but you can install additional file systems as
 well. In MS OS/2, an additional file system is referred to as an installable
 file system (IFS).

 One installable file system you can use is the high-performance file system
 (HPFS). HPFS completes the tasks of writing to and reading from your hard
 disk much faster than the FAT file system can. HPFS also allows you to use
 up to 254 characters, including some characters not allowed in the FAT file
 system, when naming files and directories; this lets you create more
 descriptive names.

 HPFS uses disk caching and lazy writing to speed up reading and writing
 tasks. In most cases, when a program needs to write information to the hard
 disk, it is not necessary that the information be written immediately. When
 you use HPFS, information that a program sends to be written to the disk is
 temporarily stored in a cache in memory. This is called disk caching. Later,
 when the disk would otherwise be idle, HPFS writes the information to the
 disk as a background activity. This is called lazy writing.

 This chapter describes how to install and use HPFS. It explains some of the
 choices you make when you install HPFS and describes the utilities that run
 differently in HPFS.


 Installing HPFS

 You can install HPFS in two ways: by using the MS OS/2 installation program
 or by copying the HPFS files to your hard disk and adding information to
 your CONFIG.SYS file. .ET

 If you choose to format the primary partition during the installation of MS
 OS/2, you must also choose which file system to use. You can choose either
 HPFS or the FAT file system. You can format the primary partition to use one
 file system and format the extended partition to use the other. For example,
 you might format the primary partition to use HPFS and format the extended
 partition to use the FAT file system. If you have chosen to use the
 dual-boot option on your hard disk, however, you cannot format your primary
 partition to use HPFS. If you choose to install dual boot and format an
 extended partition to use HPFS, you will not be able to use the HPFS
 partition when you are running DOS. The dual-boot option is described in
 Appendix B, "Using MS OS/2 Dual Boot." .RT To install HPFS on your primary
 partition by using the MS OS/2 installation program, follow these steps:

   1.  Insert the MS OS/2 Install disk in drive A and restart your system by
       pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   2.  Follow the installation instructions on your screen to create, size,
       and format the HPFS primary partition. The installation program copies
       the HPFS and MS OS/2 information to your hard disk.

   3.  When the installation program has finished, restart your system by
       pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.


 If you already have MS OS/2 (version 1.2 or higher) installed and running on
 your computer, you can install HPFS on the extended partition without going
 through the installation program again. To do this, follow these steps:

   1.  Either use Fixed Disk Utility to create an extended partition and
       logical drive on your hard disk or use an existing extended partition.
       (For information about Fixed Disk Utility, see Chapter 13, "Setting Up
       Your Hard Disk.")

   2.  Using System Editor or another text editor, add the following lines to
       the beginning of your CONFIG.SYS file:

 ifs=c:\os2\hpfs.ifs /c:64
 run=c:\os2\cache.exe /lazy:on





   3.  Using System Editor or another text editor, remove any diskcache
       configuration commands from your CONFIG.SYS file.

   4.  Close all running programs, then restart your system by pressing
       CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   5.  Format the new logical drive to use HPFS, by using the format utility
       with the /fs:hpfs option. For example, if the new logical drive is
       drive D, type the following:

 format d: /fs:hpfs







 Using Files and Directories in HPFS

 In HPFS, you can give files and directories more descriptive names than you
 can in the FAT file system. When using these HPFS nam- ing features, you
 need to be aware of how HPFS names work with MS OS/2. Naming rules and the
 interaction of HPFS filenames with MS OS/2 are described in the following
 sections. (For rules on nam- ing FAT files and directories, see Chapter 3,
 "Using File Manager.")


 Naming HPFS Files and Directories

 HPFS file and directory names may include several features that are not
 available in the FAT file system:

   ş   File and directory names can be up to 254 characters long. (In the FAT
       file system, there is a limit of 8-character filenames and 3-character
       filename extensions.) Paths and filenames together can be up to 259
       characters long.

   ş   Blank spaces and periods (.) can occur anywhere in the file or
       directory name. However, blanks and/or periods that occur at the end
       of a name are not treated by MS OS/2 as a significant part of the
       name. For example, the filenames "xyz", "xyz.", "xyz. ", and "xyz ."
       are stored by MS OS/2 as "xyz".

   ş   The following characters can be used in naming HPFS files and
       directories:

 \, + = [ ] ;


       Note that the following characters are not currently allowed in any
       file system with MS OS/2:

 < > : " / \ | * ?




   ş   You can use uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case when naming HPFS files
       and directories; the name is displayed in the directory list just as
       you typed it. However, MS OS/2 ignores case in comparing file and
       directory namesÄfor example, "Taxfile", "TAXFILE", and "taxfile" are
       the same filename to MS OS/2; only one can exist in a given directory.




 Using HPFS File and Directory Names with Commands

 You must enclose any blanks or special characters in double quotation marks
 when you type an HPFS filename or directory name on the command line so that
 MS OS/2 will recognize that they are part of the name. You can put the
 double quotation marks around the entire name or around just the blanks and
 special characters. For example, to copy a file named "My Tax File,
 1988.txt" to a directory on drive C named "Current Taxes", you can type
 either of the following:

 copy "My Tax File, 1988.txt" c:\e"Current Taxes"
 copy My" "Tax" "File", "1988.txt c:\e\Current" "Taxes


 You must also use double quotation marks any time a file or directory that
 uses the HPFS naming features is listed in batch programs.


 Transferring HPFS Files and Directories

 Because not all file systems support the use of HPFS naming features, you
 must be careful when copying and moving files between file systems. In
 general, HPFS file and directory names that use HPFS naming features cannot
 be transferred from HPFS to the FAT file system. However, these names can be
 preserved in the file's extended attributes when you transfer the file. For
 example, if you copy or move a file that uses HPFS naming features between
 file systems by using File Manager, you have the option of preserving the
 HPFS name in the file's extended attributes. (If you use the copy or move
 command at the command prompt, you must rename the file; the HPFS filename
 is lost.)

 Copying a File or Directory

 By using File Manager, you can copy a file or directory between two
 different file systems without losing the HPFS name. File Manager gives you
 the option of preserving the name in an extended attribute. The following
 example describes one method of copying a file by using File Manager; you
 also can use other methods to copy files. For more information, see Chapter
 3, "Using File Manager." To copy a file with an HPFS name from a drive that
 uses HPFS to a drive that uses the FAT file system, follow these steps:

   1.  Switch to the Main-group window and choose File Manager.

   2.  Open the directory window that contains the file you want to copy.

   3.  Select the file you want to copy.

   4.  Select the File menu and choose the Copy command. The Copy dialog box
       appears.

   5.  In the To text box, type the drive letter of the FAT file-system drive
       you want to copy the file to. (You can specify a floppy-disk drive.)

   6.  Choose the Copy button.

   7.  If you have chosen to confirm all proposed FAT file-system names, the
       Confirm dialog box appears. (To confirm proposed filenames, select the
       Options menu and choose the Confirmation command.) Choose the Copy
       button to accept the proposed filename, or type a new filename and
       choose the Copy button. Another dialog box appears if a file with the
       proposed filename already exists.



 Moving a File or Directory

 You can move a file or directory between different file systems by using
 File Manager; the method is very similar to copying a file or directory.
 When you use File Manager to move a file or directory, you have the option
 of preserving a name that uses HPFS naming features in an extended
 attribute. For more information about moving files and directories using
 File Manager, see Chapter 3, "Using File Manager."

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 In HPFS, you can change the case of a file or directory name (for example,
 from uppercase to lowercase) by using the move or the rename command and
 giving the file or directory a new name. You can use the Move or Rename
 command available in File Manager or type the command at the command prompt;
 when you type the new name, use the case you want the name to have. For
 example, to change MYTAXFILE.TXT to lowercase from the command line, you
 would type the following:
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 move MYTAXFILE.TXT mytaxfile.txt




 Preserving HPFS Names

 When File Manager copies or moves a file or directory that uses HPFS naming
 features from HPFS to the FAT file system, it modifies the name for use in
 the FAT file system and stores the HPFS name in the .LONGNAME extended
 attribute.

 In general, File Manager generates proposed file and directory names as
 follows: .ET

   ş   The base of the name is the first eight characters or the characters
       up to the last period, whichever limit is encountered first.

   ş   Any periods or special characters in the base of the name are
       converted to underscores (_).

   ş   The first three characters after the last period become the filename
       extension. (If there is no period in the filename, the proposed
       filename has no extension.)




 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you copy files from HPFS to MS-DOS or a version of MS OS/2 that does not
 support extended attributes (versions earlier than 1.2), HPFS names are
 lost.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ



 Copying or Moving a File or Directory from FAT to HPFS

 When you copy or move a file or directory from the FAT file system to HPFS,
 File Manager determines whether it has the .LONGNAME extended attribute.
 File Manager also checks to make sure that the destination file system can
 use extended attributes. If the extended .RT attribute exists and the
 destination file system can use it, the name is restored and the .LONGNAME
 extended attribute is deleted from the source file or directory. If you have
 chosen to confirm all name restorations, a dialog box appears, asking you to
 confirm the restored name. When you choose the Yes button, the name is
 restored and the extended attribute is deleted.


 Using HPFS Files with DOS and Earlier OS/2 Programs

 HPFS files and directories that use characters that FAT does not allow
 generally are not compatible with DOS programs or with programs written for
 earlier versions of MS OS/2.


 DOS Programs

 Because DOS uses the FAT file system, DOS programs are unable to process
 HPFS files whose names contain characters that are not allowed by FAT,
 multiple periods (...), or blank spaces immediately in front of the period
 preceding the filename extension (for example, "mytaxfile .txt"). When a DOS
 program attempts to access one of these files, the process is not completed
 correctly. For example, when you use the dir command in the DOS session,
 files and directories with long names or with spaces or characters not
 allowed by FAT do not appear in the directory list.

 Since DOS ignores case in file or directory names, names that use uppercase
 or mixed case but are otherwise acceptable are processed correctly.


 Earlier OS/2 Programs

 You can run a program written for MS OS/2 version 1.1 or earlier from a
 directory that uses HPFS naming features. However, like DOS programs,
 earlier OS/2 programs cannot process filenames or directory names that use
 the HPFS naming features.


 Using Wildcard Characters in HPFS

 You can use the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) wildcard characters in
 HPFS. Wildcard characters take the place of other characters when you
 specify filenames and directories in commands and utilities, and are
 especially useful when you work with groups of files.

 Generally, the asterisk matches zero or more characters in a filename. For
 example, suppose you have the following files:

 M
 MAY
 MAY.TXT
 MAY.TXT.BAK


 If you type may* when you are using the chdir, del, dir, or rmdir commands
 in HPFS, the files MAY, MAY.TXT, and MAY.TXT.BAK are matched. If you type *.
 instead, the files M and MAY are matched.

 When you use the copy, move, or rename commands in HPFS, the asterisk works
 a little differently. With each of these commands, you specify source and
 destination filenames. When you use the asterisk in the source filename, it
 works as previously described. However, when you use the asterisk in the
 destination filename, the system copies the characters that follow the
 asterisk to the destination filename. For example, if you type copy *.c
 *.bak, the copy command first finds all files that end with .C. Then it
 makes a copy of each file, using as the name of the new file the characters
 that precede the .C and adding the new .BAK extension.

 The question mark matches any single character in a filename except a period
 (.). For example, JUNE? matches JUNE, JUNE1, and JUNE2, but does not match
 JUNE3.TXT or JUNE.TXT.

 Wildcard characters are valid only in the filename that follows the last
 backslash (\) of a path.


 Running a Utility in HPFS

 Most MS OS/2 utilities
 work the same in different file systems. In the few cases in which this is
 not true, MS OS/2 determines which file system you are using and runs the
 utility for that file system. This section describes the following HPFS
 utilities, which work differently in HPFS than they do in the FAT file
 system:

   ş   format

   ş   chkdsk

   ş   recover




 Formatting a Disk

 Before you can use a hard or floppy disk, you must prepare it by using the
 format utility. You can use the format utility on new disks and on disks
 that have been formatted before. When you format a disk, any information it
 contained is lost. MS OS/2 formats a hard disk to use HPFS when you use the
 /fs option with the format utility. You cannot format a floppy disk to use
 HPFS. If you are running HPFS and you use the format utility to format a
 floppy disk, the disk is formatted as a FAT floppy disk. Suppose you want to
 format logical drive D on your hard disk to use HPFS. To do this, type the
 following:

 format d: /fs:hpfs


 There is no need to use the /t:tracks or /n:sectors options: HPFS always
 formats the disk to use the maximum number of tracks and sectors.


 Displaying Disk Information

 The chkdsk utility displays status information about
 a disk and checks a disk for errors. In HPFS, you use chkdsk as described in
 Chapter 12, "Maintaining Your System," except for the following:

   ş   Information about recovered files and extended attributes is stored in
       files named FILEnnnn





 Appendix A
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 specify a sequential number assigned by MS OS/2.) .LI Recovered directories
 and their contents are stored as directories named DIRnnnn.CHK. (The
 characters nnnn specify a sequential number assigned by MS OS/2.) These
 files are stored in a new directory named FOUND, located in the root
 directory.


 Recovering a File from a Damaged Disk

 You can use the recover utility to recover a file that has been stored in a
 bad sector on your hard disk. This utility can recover individual files
 only; it cannot recover an entire disk. To recover a file, you type recover
 followed by the name of the file to be recovered.

 The recover utility gives a recovered file its original filename, if
 possible. If the original filename cannot be restored, recover creates the
 file FILEnnnn.REC in the directory where the original file existed. (The
 characters nnnn specify a sequential number assigned by MS OS/2.)

 If the sector(s) containing a damaged file cannot be recovered, the recover
 utility retains the original file size by filling the unrecovered portion of
 the file with zeros.

 If no errors are found in a file's extended attributes, the recover utility
 preserves the extended attributes. If errors are found in the extended
 attributes, the recover utility recovers as many of the attributes as
 possible and stores them in a file named EAnnnn.REC. (The characters nnnn
 specify a sequential number assigned by MS OS/2.)


 Quitting HPFS

 It is important to use the Shutdown command to quit MS OS/2 when you are
 using the high-performance file system (HPFS). The Shutdown command (on the
 Desktop menu in Desktop Manager) saves any files that had been unsaved and
 closes the file system in an orderly fashion.

 If you do not use the Shutdown command to quit MS OS/2, the next time you
 restart your computer using HPFS or access an HPFS drive you may receive a
 message telling you that the drive may be in an inconsistent state. If you
 receive this message, prevent the loss of data by using the chkdsk utility
 to check your disk for errors. To use the chkdsk utility to fix errors on
 your HPFS drive, follow this step:

   ş   Type chkdsk followed by the HPFS drive letter and the /f option and
       press ENTER. For example, to fix the errors on logical drive D, which
       has been formatted to use HPFS, you would type the following:

 chkdsk d: /f





 If you have more than one HPFS-formatted drive, you must use the chkdsk
 utility to fix the errors on each of them.






 Chapter 17  Using MS OS/2 Device Drivers
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Introduction

 A device driver is a program that gives information to MS OS/2 about how to
 use a device in your system. MS OS/2 contains various device drivers,
 including a device driver for the keyboard, screen, printer, floppy-disk
 drive, hard-disk drive, and clock. MS OS/2 automatically loads this driver
 during installation.

 MS OS/2 also contains device drivers that you use with optional devices.
 Optional devices include a serial communications port, an external
 floppy-disk drive, and a pointing device such as a mouse. You need to set up
 the drivers for these optional devices, since MS OS/2 does not load them
 automatically.

 There are additional MS OS/2 device drivers that work with a device in your
 system to support or enhance its capabilities. These include drivers for
 using ANSI escape sequences and virtual disk drives. These drivers also need
 to be set up.

 In addition to the many device drivers MS OS/2 offers, device drivers are
 generally provided with any devices you might purchase.

 For more information about using a specific device driver, see the entry for
 that driver in the Microsoft Operating System/2 Command Reference.


 Setting Up an MS OS/2 Device Driver

 You set up a device driver in MS OS/2 by using the device configuration
 command to specify the name of the driver to load and its location in your
 system. (The device command is described in Chapter 15, "Using MS OS/2
 Configuration Commands.") This chapter describes the device drivers that you
 need to set up.

 In general, if a device driver is not located in the root directory of the
 disk from which you start your system, you need to specify the full path of
 the device driver in the device command. You can set up a device driver in
 your system when you install MS OS/2, or you can use the ddinstal utility to
 set one up later, without running the installation program again. Ddinstal
 copies device-driver files to your system and adds the appropriate device
 command to your CONFIG.SYS file. To use the ddinstal program, follow these
 steps:

   1.  At the MS OS/2 command prompt, type ddinstal and press the ENTER key.

   2.  Insert the disk that contains the device driver to be installed and
       press ENTER.

   3.  Ddinstal lists any .DDP (device-driver profile) files it finds. Select
       the device driver you want set up from the list and press ENTER. (You
       can select more than one driver.)

   4.  When prompted, insert the MS OS/2 Install disk and restart your system
       by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. (Although you use the Install disk, you will
       not go through the complete installation process again.) When the
       system restarts, the ddinstal utility continues to install the device
       driver.

   5.  When the program is finished, remove the Install disk and restart your
       system.




 Changing a Display Device Driver

 During installation, MS
 OS/2 determines what kind of display you have and loads the appropriate
 display device driver. If you replace your display, you may need to change
 the display driver. The following section describes how to change a display
 driver without running the installation program again. To change the display
 driver, follow these steps:

   1.  Define the VIDEO_DEVICES environment variable by using the set
       configuration command in your CONFIG.SYS file and listing one or more
       environment variables that describe video device handlers. For
       example, to use an IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter, define the
       VIDEO_DEVICES environment variable by placing the following line in
       your CONFIG.SYS file:

 set video_devices=vio_ibmega




   2.  Define the environment variable that you specified with the set
       video_devices command, by specifying a video device handler.


 Each video device handler is made up of one or more components that provide
 a set of functions to be used by a specific display adapter.

 Using the example from step one of the preceding list, you would define the
 VIO_IBMEGA variable by specifying the BVHEGA.DLL dynamic-link library,
 placing the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 set vio_ibmega=device(bvhega)


 As another example, suppose you were using an IBM 8514 display attached to
 an IBM 8514A display adapter. You would need to place the following lines in
 your CONFIG.SYS file:

 set video_devices=vio_ibm8514a
 set vio_ibm8514a=device(bvhvga,bvh8514a)


 In the preceding example, the BVHVGA.DLL and BVH8514A.DLL dynamic-link
 libraries both support the IBM 8514A display adapter.

 You can also specify the use of two displays. The following example shows
 the configuration commands you would specify if you were using both an IBM
 8514 display attached to an IBM 8514A display adapter and an IBM PS/2
 display attached to a VGA adapter:

 set video_devices=vio_ibmvga,vio_ibm8514a
 set vio_ibmvga=device(bvhvga)
 set vio_ibm8514a=device(bvh8514a)


 You may need to specify an additional display driver so that MS OS/2 can
 make use of the graphics functions of your display adapter while you are in
 the DOS session. You would do this by specifying the EGA.SYS device driver
 in the device configuration command in your CONFIG.SYS file, as follows:

 device=c:\os2\ega.sys


 This example directs MS OS/2 to look for the EGA.SYS device driver in the
 OS2 directory on drive C.


 Using ANSI Escape Sequences

 You can use ANSI escape sequences in the DOS session by setting up the
 ANSI.SYS device driver. ANSI escape sequences let you move the cursor, set
 the color for characters, and set the number of character rows and columns
 for the screen. Many programs use ANSI escape sequences to format screen
 output. In most cases, your program generates any ANSI escape sequences that
 are used. For example, terminal-emulation programs often pass ANSI escape
 sequences from a program on a mainframe computer to the screen. The ANSI
 escape sequences are correctly displayed only if the ANSI.SYS device driver
 is set up. You can direct MS OS/2 to load the ANSI.SYS device driver by
 adding the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=ansi.sys


 This example directs MS OS/2 to load the ANSI.SYS driver from the root
 directory of the drive from which you start your system. When MS OS/2 loads
 the device driver, it enables the ANSI escape sequences for the DOS session.
 (Support for ANSI escape sequences is automatically available in OS/2
 sessions. You can turn off ANSI support by using the ansi utility.)

 If the ANSI.SYS driver is not located in the root directory, you need to
 specify the complete path, as follows:

 device=c:\os2\ansi.sys


 This example directs MS OS/2 to load the ANSI.SYS driver from the OS2
 directory.

 If you need to design a screen display in a program you are writing, you may
 want to use ANSI escape sequences. Each escape sequence is a series of
 characters that begins with the escape character (ASCII code 27). For a list
 of the escape sequences and a description of what they do, see Appendix A,
 "ANSI Escape Sequences."


 Using a Serial Communications Port

 You can use the serial communications port by setting up the appropriate
 device driver for it. A communications port is an adapter to which the cable
 of a communications device is attached. Devices such as modems and serial
 printers are connected to this port.

 Before you set up a device driver for a communications port, you must choose
 the driver that works with your hardware. Refer to the following list to
 find the driver that matches your hardware:

 Driver                            Hardware
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 COM01.SYS                         IBM PC/AT or compatible computer

 COM02.SYS                         IBM PS/2

 To direct MS OS/2 to load the COM01.SYS device driver from the OS2 directory
 on drive C, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\com01.sys


 When this communications-port driver is loaded, MS OS/2 and DOS programs can
 use the serial communications ports on your IBM PC/AT (or compatible)
 computer.

 To use a communications port, you need to set up the port in addition to
 specifying the device driver. You set up a communications port by using
 Control Panel or by using the mode utility. (For information on the mode
 utility, see Chapter 12, "Maintaining Your System.")

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you want to use the serial version of the Microsoft Mouse, the command
 lines in the CONFIG.SYS file must appear in the following order:
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 device=c:\os2\pointdd.sys
 device=c:\os2\msser01.sys model=
 device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msser$
 device=c:\os2\com01.sys





 Using a Logical Drive Letter

 You can use a logical drive letter to name a floppy-disk drive by setting up
 the EXTDSKDD.SYS device driver. A logical drive letter, in this case, is a
 name for a physical disk drive. (The logical disk drives that you can set up
 in an extended partition on your hard disk are also parts of a physical disk
 drive, but they are different from the logical drives that you use with
 EXTDSKDD.SYS.) Using a logical drive letter, you can name an external disk
 drive, or you can assign a second name (an alias) to a disk drive and copy
 files to different places on the same disk drive. For example, to direct MS
 OS/2 to load the EXTDSKDD.SYS device driver from the OS2 directory on drive
 C, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\extdskdd.sys /d:2


 When MS OS/2 loads the driver, your MS OS/2 and DOS programs can use an IBM
 external 720K 3-inch floppy-disk drive. By default, this logical drive has
 80 tracks, nine sectors per track, and two read/write heads. The next
 available drive letter is assigned to the logical drive.

 If you want to copy from a logical drive on the external disk drive to a
 different logical drive on the same disk, add the following lines to your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\extdskdd.sys /d:2
 device=c:\os2\extdskdd.sys /d:2


 This example directs MS OS/2 to load the EXTDSKDD.SYS device driver. The
 first line associates the next available drive letter with the external disk
 drive. The second line associates an additional drive letter (an alias) with
 the same external drive. This allows you to copy data from the external disk
 drive to a logical drive on the same disk.


 Using a Mouse

 You can use a mouse with your DOS and MS OS/2 programs by setting up a mouse
 driver. Many programs, especially Presentation Manager applications, use the
 mouse if one is available. Although a mouse is not required, it makes
 working with these programs easier and quicker.


 Setting Up a Mouse Driver

 To set up a mouse driver, you must choose the driver that matches your mouse
 hardware and your computer. You specify the driver in your CONFIG.SYS file
 by using the device configuration command. The following list shows some of
 the mouse drivers that are available with MS OS/2. Each is for use with IBM
 PC/AT (and compatible) computers. These drivers contain information MS OS/2
 needs about a specific type of mouse.

 Driver                            Mouse

 MSBUS01.SYS                       Bus (parallel) Microsoft Mouse

 MSINP01.SYS                       InPort(R) (parallel) Microsoft Mouse

 MSSER01.SYS                       Serial Microsoft Mouse

 PCMOU01.SYS                       Mouse Systems PC Mouse

 VISION01.SYS                      Visi-On Mouse with IBM PC/AT

 When you use the serial version of the Microsoft Mouse, you must specify the
 model argument on the command line. Valid values are 099 (the mouse with
 green buttons) and 199 (the mouse with white buttons). For example, to use
 the Microsoft Mouse (serial version) that has white buttons, you would
 specify the mouse-dependent device driver as follows:

 device=c:\os2\msser01.sys model=


 No matter what type of mouse you use, you must always specify the following
 three files in your CONFIG.SYS file: the mouse-dependent device driver,
 shown in the preceding list; the mouse-independent device driver, MOUSE.SYS;
 and the device driver for the mouse pointer, POINTDD.SYS. You specify these
 files by using the device configuration command. The mouse-dependent driver
 must always be specified before the mouse-independent driver. For example,
 to direct MS OS/2 to load the drivers for the pointer and InPort version of
 the Microsoft Mouse, add the following lines to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\msinp01.sys
 device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msinp$
 device=c:\os2\epointdd.sys


 This example specifies that the pointer and mouse drivers are in the OS2
 directory of the start-up drive. When MS OS/2 loads these drivers, both MS
 OS/2 and DOS programs can use the InPort version of the Microsoft Mouse on
 an IBM PC/AT (or compatible) computer. The type argument on the MOUSE.SYS
 command line specifies the type of mouse you are using; this argument is
 required. The following list shows the possible values of type for some of
 the mouse drivers that are available with MS OS/2:

 Driver                            Type
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 MSBUS01.SYS                       MSBUS$

 MSINP01.SYS                       MSINP$

 MSSER01.SYS                       MSSER$

 PCMOU01.SYS                       PCMOU$

 VISION01.SYS                      VISION$



 Changing How the Mouse Device Driver Operates

 When you specify the
 mouse-dependent device driver, you can also specify the serial port to which
 the mouse is connected. You do this by using the serial option. For example,
 to specify that your mouse is connected to the COM2 serial port, add the
 following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\msser01.sys model= serial=com2


 This example specifies that the serial version of the Microsoft Mouse is
 attached to the COM2 serial port.

 When you specify the mouse-independent device driver, MOUSE.SYS, you can
 also specify the sessions in which you will use the mouse. You do this by
 using the mode option. (Do not confuse the mode option of this command with
 the mode utility.) For example, to direct MS OS/2 to enable the serial
 version of the Microsoft Mouse in all sessions, add the following line to
 your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msser$ mode=b


 This example directs MS OS/2 to use the mouse driver in Presentation
 Manager, full-screen, and DOS sessions. To use the mouse only in
 Presentation Manager and full-screen sessions, change the value that is
 specified for the mode option to p (protected mode). To use the mouse only
 in the DOS session, change the value that is specified for the mode option
 to r (real mode).

 On the same device command line, you can also specify the qsize option. The
 qsize option lets you control how much information your program receives
 from the mouse. If you want to use the mouse with DOS applications, you also
 need to set up the EGA.SYS device driver. To direct MS OS/2 to load this
 driver, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\ega.sys


 This example specifies that the EGA.SYS device driver is in the OS2
 directory on drive C.


 Using a Virtual Disk Drive

 You can use a virtual disk drive in
 full-screen and DOS sessions by setting up the VDISK.SYS device driver. When
 you use a virtual disk drive, your system simulates a disk drive in memory
 and provides quick access to files stored there. You may want to use a
 virtual disk as a place in which temporary files are stored. Since temporary
 files are deleted when they are no longer needed, there is no reason to save
 them on a disk. To direct MS OS/2 to load the VDISK.SYS device driver from
 the OS2 directory on drive C, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS
 file:

 device=c:\os2\vdisk.sys


 This line must come after any device commands that load the EXTDSKDD.SYS
 device driver in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 If the driver is found, MS OS/2 loads it and creates a 64K virtual disk with
 128-byte sectors, 64 directory entries, and the name of the next available
 drive letter. (These are the default values.)

 Any information stored on a virtual disk is lost when your computer is
 restarted or turned off. If you use a virtual disk for temporary files, be
 sure to specify the appropriate drive letter with the set temp configuration
 command in your CONFIG.SYS file. This command tells MS OS/2 where to place
 all temporary files.

 You can have more than one virtual disk drive. Drive letters for virtual
 disks are assigned in the order in which the device commands appear in the
 CONFIG.SYS file. When you specify memory for a virtual disk, that memory is
 no longer available for other programs to use.

 You may want to increase the size of the virtual disk drive, since 64K is
 not very much space. You could do this by adding the following line to your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\vdisk.sys 128


 This example creates a 128K virtual disk with 128-byte sectors and 64
 directory entries.

 You may also want to change the number of directory entries for the virtual
 disk drive. You could do this by adding the following line to your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\vdisk.sys 256,128


 This example creates a 256K virtual disk with 128-byte sectors and 128
 directory entries. Note that a sector size is not specified; the place where
 it would be specified is designated by a comma. (If you wanted to specify
 all three values, you would separate them with spaces.)

 When you specify a value for the number of directory entries, the value is
 rounded up to the nearest sector-size boundary. For example, if you give a
 value of 25 and your sector size is 512 bytes, 25 will be rounded up to 32,
 which is the next multiple of 16. (There are sixteen 32-byte directory
 entries in 512 bytes.)

 The maximum size of a virtual disk depends on the amount of available memory
 in your system, but it cannot be larger than 4 megabytes. If the virtual
 disk size specified is too large to fit in memory, VDISK.SYS will attempt to
 make a virtual disk that is 16K. This may result in a virtual disk with a
 different number of directory entries than you specified.

 When you start or restart your system, MS OS/2 displays information about
 any virtual disk it creates. The information includes the assigned drive
 letter, the size of the virtual disk, its sector size, and the number of
 directory entries. You can also use the chkdsk utility to determine the size
 of a virtual disk.

 Introduction

 This appendix lists all of the escape sequences that you can use with the
 ANSI.SYS device driver in the DOS session or with the ansi command in either
 a full-screen session or in a window running the MS OS/2 command
 interpreter, cmd.

 ANSI escape sequences affect cursor positioning, erase functions, and screen
 graphics.

 You must type the escape sequences exactly as shown, without spaces. Each
 escape sequence begins with the escape character (ASCII code 27) and the
 left-bracket character. (You cannot press the ESC key to produce the escape
 character.)


 Cursor Functions

 The following functions affect the movement of the cursor.


 Cursor Position


 esc[row;colH

 or

 esc[row;colf



 These escape sequences move the cursor to the position specified by the row
 and column arguments. When no arguments are provided, the cursor moves to
 the home position (the upper-left corner of the screen).


 Cursor Up


 esc[nA


 This escape sequence moves the cursor up n rows without changing columns. If
 the cursor is already on the top line, no action is taken.


 Cursor Down


 esc[nB


 This escape sequence moves the cursor down n rows without changing columns.
 If the cursor is already on the bottom row, no action is taken.


 Cursor Forward


 esc[nC


 This escape sequence moves the cursor forward n columns without changing
 lines. If the cursor is already in the far-right column, no action is taken.



 Cursor Backward


 esc[nD


 This escape sequence moves the cursor back n columns without changing lines.
 If the cursor is already in the far-left column, no action is taken.


 Save Cursor Position


 esc[s


 This escape sequence saves the current cursor position; the cursor can be
 returned to the saved position by using the Restore Cursor Position escape
 sequence.


 Restore Cursor Position


 esc[u


 This escape sequence restores the cursor to the position specified with the
 Save Cursor Position escape sequence.


 Erase Functions

 The following functions erase the screen.


 Erase Display


 esc[2J


 This escape sequence erases the contents of the screen and moves the cursor
 to the home position (the upper-left corner of the screen).


 Erase Line


 esc[K


 This escape sequence erases from the cursor to the end of the line
 (including the cursor position).


 Screen Graphics Functions

 The following functions affect screen graphics.


 Set Graphics Rendition


 esc[g; ... ;gm


 This escape sequence calls the graphics functions specified by the numeric
 values described in the following list. The specified functions remain in
 effect until the next occurrence of this escape sequence. This escape
 sequence works only if the screen device supports graphics.

 The g variable may have any of the following values:

 Appendix B  Using MS OS/2 Dual Boot
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Introduction

 This appendix describes how to install and use MS OS/2 dual boot on your
 computer. With dual boot, you can start MS OS/2 and DOS from the same hard
 disk.


 Installing Dual Boot

 In order to install MS OS/2 dual boot on your hard disk, you must already
 have either DOS (version 3.2 or higher) or an earlier version of MS OS/2
 dual boot installed on your computer. The MS OS/2 installation program does
 not install DOS on your computer.

 If you have chosen to use the high-performance file system (HPFS) on your
 start-up drive, you cannot install dual boot.


 Creating a DOS Directory

 If you have been running only DOS, you must create a DOS directory and copy
 your DOS files and directories to this new directory before you install MS
 OS/2 dual boot. To create the directory and copy your files to it, follow
 these steps:

   1.  Use the mkdir command to create a new directory for your DOS files.
       For example, to create a directory named DOS on drive C, type the
       following:

 mkdir c:\dos




   2.  Copy all of your DOS files to the new DOS directory. For example, to
       copy all of your DOS files from the root directory on drive C to the
       new DOS directory, type the following:

 copy c:\*.* c:\dos







 Editing the DOS Configuration Files

 You also need to specify the location of your DOS files for MS OS/2 by
 modifying the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, using System Editor or
 another text editor.

 If you have only DOS on your computer, be sure to modify the original
 CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files in your root (C:\) directory. (Do not
 modify the copies in the C:\DOS directory. You may delete these copies if
 you wish, since they are not used by MS OS/2 dual boot.)

 If you have an earlier version of MS OS/2, be sure to make your changes to
 the DOS versions of these files. When you are running DOS, the files you
 should change are named CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT; when you are running MS
 OS/2, the files are named CONFIG.DOS and AUTOEXEC.DOS. To modify the
 CONFIG.SYS file, follow these steps:

   1.  Specify the location of COMMANDthe shell configuration command. For
       example, if COMMANDDOS directory on drive C, place the following line
       in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 shell=c:\dos\command.com c:\dos /p




   2.  Edit any device and country configuration commands so that they
       specify the new DOS directory.


 To modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, follow these steps:

   1.  Edit the set comspec command so that it specifies the location of the
       DOS command interpreter, COMMANDDOS directory on drive C, place the
       following line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

 set comspec=c:\dos\command.com




   2.  Add the DOS directory to the set path command. For example, the edited
       set path command could look like the following:

 set path=c:\batch;c:\bin;c:\os2;c:\dos




   3.  Add the following line to copy COMMANDC:

 copy c:\dos\command.com c:\







 Running the Installation Program

 You install dual boot when you use the MS OS/2 installation program, which
 determines if you can use dual boot on your computer by checking whether you
 have already installed DOS (version 3.2 or higher) or a previous version of
 MS OS/2 dual boot. Make sure that you have moved your DOS files to a
 separate directory and modified your DOS configuration files before you run
 the MS OS/2 installation program. To install dual boot, follow these steps:

   1.  Insert the MS OS/2 Install disk into drive A and turn on your
       computer. If your computer is already on, restart it by pressing
       CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   2.  Follow the instructions on your screen to install dual boot.


 After you install dual boot on your computer, you will find copies of the
 DOS configuration files in the C:\OS2\SYSTEM directory of your hard disk.

 When you start MS OS/2, the MS OS/2 configuration files are copied to
 CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT in your root (C:\) directory, and the DOS
 configuration files that had been named CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are
 copied to the files CONFIG.DOS and AUTOEXEC.DOS in your C:\OS2\SYSTEM
 directory.

 When you start DOS, this process is reversed: the DOS configuration files
 are copied to CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT in your root directory, and the MS
 OS/2 files are copied to CONFIG.OS2 and AUTOEXEC.OS2 in your C:\OS2\SYSTEM
 directory.


 Using Dual Boot

 Once you have installed MS OS/2 dual boot, you use the boot utility to
 specify which operating system you want to use the next time you start your
 computer. For example, if you are using DOS and you decide you want to use
 MS OS/2 instead, you start the boot utility in DOS and specify MS OS/2. The
 boot utility renames the DOS and MS OS/2 configuration files and then
 prompts you to restart your computer. The following sections describe how to
 use the boot utility.


 Starting MS OS/2

 To use the boot utility to start MS OS/2, follow these steps:

   1.  At the DOS prompt, type the following:

 c:\os2\boot /os2




   2.  The boot utility runs and renames the DOS and MS OS/2 configuration
       files. When it has finished, the boot utility restarts your computer
       using MS OS/2.




 Starting DOS

 Using dual boot, you can start DOS from the command line of an OS/2 session,
 or you can add the boot utility to the Utilities group and start DOS from
 there. By adding the boot utility to the Utilities group, you can start the
 utility easier and faster. To add the boot utility to the Utilities group,
 follow these steps:

   1.  Select the Program menu from the Utilities group and choose the New
       command.

   2.  Type the following in the Program Title box:

 Dual Boot




   3.  Type the following in the Path and File Name box:

 c:\os2\boot.com




   4.  Type the following in the Parameters box:

 /dos




   5.  Choose the Add button.


 For more information about adding an application or utility to a program
 group, see Chapter 2, "Running Applications with MS OS/2."

 To start DOS by using the Dual Boot utility, switch to the Utilities group
 and double-click "Dual Boot." The utility copies the MS OS/2 and DOS
 configuration files, saves any changes you have made to data files, closes
 the file system and any running applications, and restarts your computer.

 If you upgrade your version of DOS while using MS OS/2 dual boot, make sure
 you run the DOS installation program from DOS, not from MS OS/2; otherwise,
 the MS OS/2 boot record and configuration files could be overwritten.

 The DOS installation program can sometimes make the OS2LDR file
 noncontiguous. This file must be contiguous in order to start MS OS/2. If,
 when you start MS OS/2, you receive a message telling you that the OS2LDR
 file is noncontiguous, you must reinstall MS OS/2.


 Displaying the Current Boot Setting

 You can also use the boot utility to query which operating system will be
 used the next time you start your computer. To do this, type the following:

 c:\os2\boot /q









 Appendix C  Using Picture Utilities
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ




 Introduction


 The picture utilitiesÄPrint Picture, Display Picture, and Convert Picture
 FileÄare Presentation Manager applications that you use to work with special
 graphics files. The graphics files can be in either of two formats: picture
 interchange or metafile. Picture interchange files have a .PIF filename
 extension and metafiles have a .MET filename extension. You use the picture
 utilities to print, display, and convert these graphics files in
 Presentation Manager. This appendix briefly describes the purpose of the
 picture utilities and how to start them. For more detailed information on
 working with the picture utilities, use Help.

 Starting Picture Utilities

 You start the picture utilities from the Utilities group window. To start a
 picture utility, follow these steps:

   1.  Switch to Desktop Manager and select the Utilities group.

   2.  In the Utilities group, choose the picture utility you want to
       startÄPrint Picture, Display Picture, or Convert Picture File.




 Print Picture

 You use the Print Picture utility to print graphics files on your printer.
 The filenames end with either a .MET or .PIF extension. You use the commands
 on the File menu to select and print these graphics files. The following
 list summarizes the commands on the File menu:

 Command                           Action
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Select                            Specifies the graphics files to be
                                   printed. The files must have a .PIF or
                                   .MET filename extension. Files with a
                                   .PIF extension are converted to metafile
                                   format (.MET extension) for printing
                                   with Presentation Manager.

 Print                             Prints graphics files on your printer.
                                   You can specify the number of copies you
                                   want.

 Exit                              Quits the Print Picture utility.

 You set printing options by using the commands on the Control menu. The
 following list summarizes the commands on the Control menu:

 Command                           Action
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Change Printer                    Selects the printer to use (if you have
