 Welcome
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 This reference describes, in alphabetical order, the commands, utilities,
 and other programs you can use from the command prompt with Microsoft(R)
 Operating System/2. The entries include the following:

   ş   MS(R) OS/2 commands and utilities

   ş   DOS commands and utilities

   ş   Batch commands

   ş   Configuration commands

   ş   MS OS/2 device drivers

 In this manual, the term "DOS" refers to the MS-DOS(R) and IBM Personal
 Computer DOS operating systems.

 This manual is intended to be a reference for experienced users. For
 additional information about MS OS/2 and the Presentation Manager
 environment, see the following manuals:

   ş   To learn how to install MS OS/2 and quickly get started with
       Presentation Manager and MS OS/2, see Microsoft Operating System/2
       Getting Started.

   ş   For a comprehensive description of the Presentation Manager
       environment, the MS OS/2 and DOS command interpreters, batch programs,
       configuration commands, and device drivers, see the Microsoft
       Operating System/2 User's Guide.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 All examples of filenames and directory names in this reference are for the
 file allocation table (FAT) file system. To use high-performance file system
 (HPFS) file and directory names with the MS OS/2 commands and utilities, you
 must enclose the names in quotation marks, to ensure that MS OS/2 correctly
 interprets any spaces or special characters in the names. For example,
 without the quotation marks, MS OS/2 would interpret a plus sign (+) in an
 HPFS filename in a copy command as an instruction to combine two files. For
 more information about HPFS, see the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's
 Guide.

 Commands and Utilities

 The following section lists MS OS/2 command-line commands and utilities by
 type. Included are MS OS/2 commands and utilities, DOS commands and
 utilities, batch commands, and configuration commands.


 Commands

 A command-line command is any word or phrase that you can type at a prompt
 in order to carry out an action. MS OS/2 command-line commands are built
 into one or both of two programs: cmd (the MS OS/2 command interpreter) and
 command (the DOS command interpreter).

 The command-line commands include special sets of commands for configuring
 your system and for running batch files.

 Fixed Disk Utility

 Prepares a hard disk for formatting. You can create primary and extended
 partitions and logical drives, display information about the existing
 partitions and logical drives, and, if your system has multiple hard disks,
 select the next hard disk for partitioning. (To delete the primary MS OS/2
 partition from the hard disk that you start your system from, you must use
 the fdisk /d utility, which you run from the MS OS/2 Install disk.)

 Notational Conventions

 To help you locate and interpret information easily, this manual uses icons,
 a standard syntax format and terminology, and specific typographic
 conventions. The following sections describe these elements.


 Icons

 The following icons appear in the left margin and indicate where you can use
 the command or utility described in the adjacent text.
 MS OS/2                 DOS             Configuration file


 Syntax

 Syntax represents the order in which you must type a command-line command or
 utility name and any arguments and options that follow it. Elements that
 appear in bold type must be typed exactly as they appear in the syntax line;
 elements that appear in italic are placeholders representing specific
 information that you will need to supply. Unless specified otherwise, you
 can type commands, arguments, and options in either uppercase or lowercase
 letters.

 The following is a sample syntax line:



 sample [+r|-r] [drive:][path]\^filename [...] [options]

 The meaning of each of these elements is as follows:

 Number                            Element     Meaning
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 1                                 sample      Specifies the name of the

                                               choices (that is, break on
                                               or break off); do not type
                                               the symbol itself.

 4                                 drive:      Specifies a drive. You need
                                               to specify a drive with a
                                               filename only if you are
                                               using a file that is not on
                                               the current drive.

 5                                 path        Specifies a complete
                                               directory path, using the
                                               following syntax:

                                               You need to specify a path
                                               with a filename only if the
                                               file is not in the current

 source                            Specifies the drive, directory, file, or
                                   device that will be transferred to a
                                   specified destination or used as input

                                   characters and is usually enclosed in
                                   double quotation marks. Some commands,
                                   such as find, work with strings of text.

                                   time; for example, "Press ALT+ESC" means
                                   that you press the ALT key and hold it
                                   down while you press and release the ESC

                                   example, "Press ALT, SPACEBAR" means
                                   that you press the ALT key and release
                                   it, and then you press the SPACEBAR and

 DIRECTION keys                    Arrow keys on your computer keypad are
                                   called DIRECTION keys. The individual
                                   name refers to the direction the arrow
                                   on the key points: UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT.



 Ansi

   ®OS2¯

 ansi [on|off]

 Turns the support on or off for ANSI escape sequences in an OS/2 session.
 The default setting is on.

 If you type ansi by itself, the utility displays the current setting.


 ANSI.SYS

   ®CONFIG¯

 device=[drive:][path]ansi.sys

 Directs MS OS/2 to load the ANSI.SYS device driver. To use this command,
 place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 When the ANSI.SYS device driver is loaded, you can use ANSI escape sequences
 in a DOS session to move the cursor, set the color for characters, and set
 the number of character rows and columns for the screen.

 Support for ANSI escape sequences is automatically available in an OS/2
 session.

 For a list of the escape sequences used in the ANSI.SYS device driver, see
 the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's Guide.


 Append

   ®DOS¯

 append [/e|;|[drive:]path[;...]] [/path[:on|:off]]

 Specifies which directories besides the current directory MS OS/2 should
 search in order to find an application's data files.

 /e                                Stores the appended paths in the
                                   environment. You should use the /e
                                   option by itself, without any drive or
                                   path. MS OS/2 accepts this option only
                                   the first time you use the append
                                   utility after starting MS OS/2. If you
                                   use the /e option a second time, you
                                   receive an error message.

 ;                                 When used by itself (append ;), cancels
                                   the existing appended path. Semicolons
                                   are also used to separate multiple paths.

 [drive:]path                      Specifies the directory path MS OS/2
                                   searches for an application's data files.
                                   You can specify more than one path,
                                   separating them with semicolons.

 /path[:on                         Specifies whether MS OS/2 should search
                                   the appended directories when the
                                   filename that an application is looking
                                   for already includes a drive letter
                                   and/or path. If you specify /path:off,
                                   MS OS/2 does not search the appended
                                   directories; if you specify /path:on or
                                   simply /path by itself, MS OS/2 searches
                                   the directories. The default setting is
                                   /path:on.

 Each time you use the append utility, the new path you specify takes the
 place of the previous path. If you use the /e option the first time you use
 append, each new path is stored in the MS OS/2 environment.

 If you type append by itself, the utility displays the current data path.

 The append utility achieves the same results in the DOS session as the
 "dpath" command does in an OS/2 session. Example

 To instruct an application to search the REPORTS and NOTES subdirectories of
 the DATA directory on the current drive and the REPORTS directory on drive
 B, type the following:

 append \data\reports;\data\notes;b:\reports


 Assign

   ®DOS¯

 assign [drive1=drive2] [...]

 Assigns the drive letter of one drive to a different drive, so that if you
 request the first drive you get the second.

 drive1                            Specifies the drive letter you want to
                                   reassign.

 drive2                            Specifies the drive letter you want to
                                   substitute for drive1.]

 Do not type a colon (:) after the drive letters.

 You can make more than one drive assignment in a single command line.

 If you type assign by itself, the utility resets all drive letters to their
 original drives.

 Do not use the assign utility unless you need to. You can easily forget that
 you have reassigned a drive letter and end up changing files on an
 unexpected drive. Also, many programs require information about a drive's
 characteristics in order to work properly. If you have reassigned drive
 letters, these programs may not work as you expect.

 The assign utility affects only the DOS session. Example

 Suppose you want to run an application on your hard disk (drive C) and the
 application requires you to put your program disk in drive A and your data
 disk in drive B. To send all references to drives A and B to drive C, type
 the following:

 assign a=c b=c


 Attrib (Attributes)

   ®OS2¯

 attrib [+r|-r] [+a|-a] [drive:][path]filename [/s]

 Changes or displays the flags of the file you specify. The flags determine
 whether the file is read-only and whether it is affected when you use the
 "backup" , "restore" , and "xcopy" utilities. For more information, see the
 individual utility descriptions.

 +r                                Makes the file read-only.

 -r                                Allows the file to be changed or deleted.

 +a                                Sets the archive flag of the file.

 -a                                Clears the archive flag of the file.

 filename                          Specifies the file for which you want to
                                   change the flags. You can use wildcard
                                   characters to affect more than one file.

 /s                                Changes the flags of all files named
                                   filename in subdirectories as well as in
                                   directories.


 To see the flag settings of a particular file, type only attrib and the
 filename. If the letter A appears in the listing, the archive flag is set
 for the file; if R appears in the listing, the read-only flag is set.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To make all the files read-only in the directory \eSCHEDULE\eMEETINGS on
 drive C, and in all its subdirectories, type the following:

 attrib +r c:\eschedule\emeetings\e* /s


 Autofail

   ®CONFIG¯

 autofail=yes|no

 Turns on or off the mechanism by which MS OS/2 displays a full-screen error
 message that requires a choice of actions whenever the system encounters a
 hard error or an exception condition. To use this command, place it in your
 CONFIG.SYS file.

 yes                               Turns on the autofail mechanism,
                                   preventing MS OS/2 from displaying a
                                   full-screen error message for a hard
                                   error or exception condition. MS OS/2
                                   returns an error code to the program
                                   instead. You may still see a
                                   command-line error message.

 no                                Turns off the autofail mechanism,
                                   allowing MS OS/2 to display a
                                   full-screen error message for a hard
                                   error or exception condition. This is
                                   the default setting.

 A hard error is caused by something external to the software, such as an
 open disk-drive door or an incorrectly formatted floppy disk. An exception
 condition is caused by an instruction that the central processing unit (CPU)
 cannot execute, such as dividing by zero.

 When the autofail mechanism is turned off, the system stops and displays a
 full-screen error message when a hard error or exception condition occurs;
 you must choose an action from a list in the error screen before the system
 will resume processing commands. When the autofail mechanism is turned on,
 the system continues processing the command that caused the error.


 Backup

   ®OS2¯

 backup drive1:[path][filename] drive2: [/s] [/m] [/a] [/f[:size]] [/d:date
 [/t:time]] [/l:[path]logfile]

 Makes backup copies of files from one disk and stores them on another. You
 can then use the "restore" utility to copy these files back to their
 original location.

 drive1:                           Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   files you want to make backup copies of.

 filename                          Specifies a single file you want to make
                                   a backup copy of. You can use wildcard
                                   characters to make backup copies of a
                                   group of files with similar names.

 drive2:                           Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   disk on which you want to store the
                                   backup files. The backup utility places
                                   the files in the root directory of this
                                   disk. If you choose to put the backup
                                   copies onto a hard disk, backup
                                   automatically creates a directory named
                                   BACKUP as a subdirectory of the root
                                   directory and places the files there.

 /s                                Makes backup copies of the contents of
                                   all the subdirectories.

 /m                                Makes backup copies of only the files
                                   that have been changed since the last
                                   backup operation and turns off the
                                   archive flag of the original file. This
                                   option also makes backup copies of
                                   directories if their extended attributes
                                   have changed. Previous backup copies are
                                   deleted unless you also specify the /a
                                   option.

 /a                                Adds the backup files being created to
                                   the backup files on the destination disk
                                   without deleting the files that are
                                   already there. This option does not work
                                   if any of the files on the destination
                                   disk are backup copies made by using the
                                   backup utility from MS-DOS version 3.21
                                   or earlier.

 /f[:size]                         Formats the destination disk if it is
                                   unformatted. This option does not format
                                   a nonremovable disk, nor does it format
                                   a disk that is already formatted. You
                                   can specify the memory capacity of the
                                   disk, in kilobytes (or, for a
                                   1.2-megabyte or 1.44-megabyte disk, in
                                   megabytes), by specifying size. The
                                   easiest way to specify size is as the
                                   number of kilobytes of memory on the
                                   disk (360, 720, 1200, or 1440), but you
                                   can include the unit of measurement (for
                                   example, 360K, 360KB, 1.2M, 1.2MB) if
                                   you prefer. The backup utility formats
                                   an unformatted destination disk even if
                                   you do not specify the /f option.

 /d:date                           Makes backup copies of only the files
                                   that were changed on or after the date
                                   specified.

 /t:time                           Makes backup copies of only the files
                                   that were changed at or after the time
                                   specified. Do not use this option
                                   without the /d:date option.

 /l[:logfile]                      Creates a log file in the root directory
                                   of the source disk or drive and puts a
                                   log of the backup operation in that file.
                                   You can specify a different drive or
                                   directory for the log file. If you do
                                   not specify logfile, the backup utility
                                   names the file BACKUP.LOG.


 The backup files are stored in the BACKUP.nnn and CONTROL.nnn files; nnn is
 the number of the disk (starting from 001). As each disk is filled, the
 backup utility prompts you for the next disk.

 The source and destination disks do not have to be of the same type; you can
 back up files from a hard disk to a floppy disk, or from one kind of floppy
 disk to another. If you do not specify the /a option, the backup utility
 erases all the files that are already on the destination disk.

 The backup utility preserves the extended attributes of the files and
 directories that it copies.

 The backup utility does not make backup copies of the following files:
 OS2LDR, OS2KRNL, IBMBIOCMDyour start-up drive; to make a complete backup of
 your start-up drive, you must run backup from the MS OS/2 Install disk.
 Example

 If you want to make backup copies of all the files in the \eFILM\eCRITIQUE
 directory on drive C and store them on an unformatted disk in drive A, type
 the following:

 backup c:\efilm\ecritique a: /f

 To make backup copies of the files on drive C, which is your start-up drive,
 and store them on an unformatted disk in drive B, insert the MS OS/2 Install
 disk in drive A, press CTRL+ALT+DEL, press ESC when the logo appears, and
 type the following at the command prompt:

 backup c: b: /f


 Boot

 [drive:][path]boot [/dos | /os2 | /q]

 Specifies the operating system (DOS or MS OS/2) your computer is to use the
 next time you restart it. You must have dual boot installed on your computer
 before you can use the boot utility.

 /dos                              Specifies DOS as the operating system to
                                   be used the next time you restart your
                                   computer.

 /os2                              Specifies MS OS/2 as the operating
                                   system to be used the next time you
                                   restart your computer.

 /q                                Displays the current boot setting.


 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Warning

 It is not a good idea to use dual boot if you have files or directories on
 your system that use extended attributes. Using DOS utilities or
 applications to manipulate such files or directories may delete their
 extended attributes. Example

 To instruct your system, when you are running DOS, to use MS OS/2 the next
 time you restart the computer, type the following:

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 c:\os2\boot /os2


 Break

   ®DOS¯

 break [on|off]

 Specifies when MS OS/2 is to check for the key combination CTRL+C (or
 CTRL+BREAK) in the DOS session. MS OS/2 stops the program or batch file that
 is running when it encounters the combination.

 Depending on the program you are running, you may press CTRL+C in the DOS
 session to stop an activity (for example, to stop sorting a file).
 Ordinarily, MS OS/2 checks for CTRL+C only when it is reading from the
 keyboard or writing to the screen or the printer. If you type break on, you
 extend CTRL+C checking to other activities, such as reading from or writing
 to a disk. The default setting in the DOS session is off (unless otherwise
 set in your CONFIG.SYS file by the break configuration command).

 The break command has no effect on an OS/2 session; MS OS/2 always checks
 for CTRL+C in this session.

 If you type break by itself, MS OS/2 displays the command's current setting.


 Some programs are designed to respond to CTRL+C at any time; the break
 command does not affect them.

 In the DOS session, when you use CTRL+C to stop the processing of a batch
 file, MS OS/2 displays a message that asks you to confirm that you want to
 stop the batch process. In an OS/2 session, however, you receive no message;
 as soon as you press CTRL+C, the batch file stops.


 Break

   ®CONFIG¯

 break=on|off

 Specifies when MS OS/2 is to check for the CTRL+C (or CTRL+BREAK) key
 combination in the DOS session. MS OS/2 stops the program or batch file that
 is running when it encounters the combination. To use the break
 configuration command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 If break is off, MS OS/2 checks for CTRL+C only when it is reading from the
 keyboard or writing to the screen or the printer. When break is on, MS OS/2
 also checks for CTRL+C every time it reads from or writes to a disk. The
 default setting for break in the DOS session is off.

 The break configuration command has no effect on an OS/2 session; MS OS/2
 always checks for CTRL+C in this session.


 Buffers

   ®CONFIG¯

 buffers=number

 Sets the number of buffers in memory, for use by the FAT file system. To use
 this command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 number                            Specifies the number of buffers
                                   available. This must be a number in the
                                   range 1 through 100. During system
                                   installation, the value of the buffers
                                   command is set to 30. If you remove the
                                   buffers command from your CONFIG.SYS
                                   file, the system sets the value to 3.

 Buffers are work areas MS OS/2 uses to hold data when it is reading from or
 writing to a disk. You can speed up your system's performance by increasing
 the number of buffers available, but when you do so you also reduce the
 amount of memory available. Example

 To create 20 disk buffers, include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS
 file:

 buffers=20


 Cache

   ®OS2¯

 cache [/MaxAge:time] [/DiskIdle:time] [/BufferIdle:time]

 or

 cache [/lazy:on|/lazy:off]

 Directs MS OS/2 to load the cache driver for the high-performance file
 system (HPFS), turn lazy writing on or off, and set or display the
 lazy-writing parameters. You must have HPFS installed on your computer
 before you can use the cache utility. (For more information about installing
 HPFS, see the "ifs" configuration command.)

 /MaxAge:time                      Sets the maximum amount of time (in
                                   milliseconds) that a cache block can
                                   store information before MS OS/2 writes
                                   that information to the disk. The
                                   default time is 5000 milliseconds.

 /DiskIdle:time                    Sets the maximum amount of time (in
                                   milliseconds) that the disk can be idle
                                   before MS OS/2 writes unsaved
                                   information in the cache blocks to the
                                   disk. The default time is 1000
                                   milliseconds. This option affects only
                                   cache blocks that have had unsaved
                                   information in them for the amount of
                                   time specified by /BufferIdle.

 /BufferIdle:time                  Sets the maximum amount of time (in
                                   milliseconds) that a cache block can
                                   store information before it becomes
                                   subject to the effect of the /DiskIdle
                                   option. The default time is 500
                                   milliseconds.

 /lazy:on|/lazy:off                Turns lazy writing on or off for all
                                   disks or partitions that are formatted
                                   for HPFS. The default setting is
                                   /lazy:on. For more information about
                                   lazy writing, see the Microsoft
                                   Operating System/2 User's Guide.


 On disks or partitions formatted for HPFS, MS OS/2 can store information in
 temporary 2-kilobyte cache blocksÄwhere the system can locate it
 fasterÄrather than writing the information directly to the disk. The cache
 options determine when the information in the cache block is written to the
 disk. If lazy writing is not turned on, MS OS/2 writes information directly
 to the disk, rather than storing it in cache blocks.

 If you use the cache utility to turn lazy writing on, the prompt disappears
 in the session in which you are running the utility. To avoid this, use the
 "start" command to create a new OS/2 session to be used only for running the
 cache utility.

 If you type cache by itself, the utility displays its current setting.
 Example

 To start a new session and run the cache utility, turning lazy writing on,
 type the following:

 start cache /lazy:on


 Call

   ®OS2¯

 call [drive:][path]batchfile [arg]

 Calls one batch file from another. You use call in a batch file in order to
 run another batch file and then return to the first one. Although call can
 be used from the command prompt, it is designed to be placed in a batch
 file.

 batchfile                         Specifies the name of the batch file
                                   (without extension) that you want to
                                   call from within another batch file.

 arg                               Specifies an argument to the batch file
                                   being called.

 When you use the call command, MS OS/2 treats everything in the batch file
 you call as though it were a single command; once that command has been
 carried out (that is, once the second batch file has been run), MS OS/2
 resumes running the first batch file where it left off.

 Do not use pipes or redirection symbols with the call command.

 You cannot call DOS batch files (files with the extension .BAT) from an MS
 OS/2 batch file (a file with the extension "cmd" , the MS OS/2 command
 interpreter.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that you cannot call MS OS/2 batch files (files with the extension from a
 DOS batch file (a file with the extension .BAT) or from "command" , the DOS
 command interpreter.

 Example

 To run the file CHECKNEW/t option, include the following line in the first
 batch file:

 call checknew /t


 Call

   ®CONFIG¯

 call=[drive:][path]filename [arguments]

 Starts and runs a program in the foreground when you start your system. If
 you want to run a program that requires input from you, use this command
 rather than the "run" command. To use the call command, place it in your
 CONFIG.SYS file.

 filename                          Specifies the program you want to start.
                                   You must include the extension (located
                                   in the root directory of your start-up
                                   drive. The file cannot be a batch file.

 arguments                         Specifies any valid options or other
                                   variables for the program you are
                                   calling.

 When you use the call configuration command to run a program, MS OS/2 treats
 everything the program does as a single command; once that command has been
 carried out (that is, once the program has started, received any input
 needed from you, done whatever it does, and ended), MS OS/2 resumes
 processing the CONFIG.SYS file where it left off.

 You can include more than one call command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 MS OS/2 processes all "device" commands in your CONFIG.SYS file before it
 starts processing call commands.

 You can use the call configuration command to start monitor programs for
 other sessions, but not for the session from which you are using call.
 Example

 To run the "chkdsk" utility for drive D each time you start your system,
 when CHKDSKyour CONFIG.SYS file:

 call=c:\os2\chkdsk.com d:


 Chcp (Change Code Page)

   ®OS2¯

 chcp [nnn]

 Switches to the specified system code page, which must have been defined
 previously in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 nnn                               Specifies the code page to be used. This
                                   argument must be a three-digit number
                                   from the list under the "codepage"
                                   command.

 If you type chcp by itself, MS OS/2 displays the number of the active code
 page and the numbers of the prepared code pages for that session.

 You can use this command only if code pages have been previously prepared by
 using the "codepage" command.

 Any program that you run after starting a new code page uses the new code
 page. Programs that started running before you started the new code page
 still use the original code page.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that when you type chcp by itself, MS OS/2 displays only the number of the
 active code page.

 Example

 To switch the code page to 860 (Portuguese), type the following:

 chcp 860


 Chdir (Change Directory)

   ®OS2¯

 chdir [drive:][path]

 Changes the current directory. You can abbreviate chdir as cd.

 If you type chdir by itself, MS OS/2 displays the name of the current
 directory of the current drive.

 You cannot use chdir to change drives, but you can use it to change the
 current directory of another drive. If you then switch to that drive, you
 will be in the directory you specified. Typing chdir plus the letter of
 another drive displays the name of the current directory on that drive.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Examples

 To change from your current directory to the ENTREE subdirectory, type the
 following:

 cd entree

 To change from your current directory to its parent directory, type the
 following:

 cd ..

 To return to the root directory, type the following:

 cd \

 If your current directory is POETRY and its parent directory is BOOKS, and
 you want to change to the FICTION directory, which is also under BOOKS, type
 the following:

 cd ..\fiction


 Chkdsk (Check Disk)

   ®OS2¯

 chkdsk [drive:][path][filename] [/c] [/f[:n]] [/v]

 Checks a disk or partition for errors and displays a summary of how space is
 used on that disk or partition. The chkdsk utility also displays the volume
 label, the volume serial number, and the type of file system being used by
 the disk or partition.

 drive:                            Specifies the disk drive to check. If
                                   you do not specify drive, the chkdsk
                                   utility checks the current drive.

 filename                          (FAT file system only) Specifies the
                                   file to check. You can use wildcard
                                   characters to specify a group of files.
                                   The chkdsk utility reports how many of
                                   the specified files are stored in
                                   noncontiguous sectors.

 /c                                (HPFS only) Specifies that the chkdsk
                                   utility is to correct errors only if the
                                   file system was in an inconsistent state
                                   when you restarted your computer; if the
                                   file system was in a consistent state,
                                   chkdsk simply terminates, regardless of
                                   what other options you have specified.
                                   (The file system may be left in an
                                   inconsistent state if the system crashes
                                   or is restarted while there are open
                                   files or while the directory structure
                                   is being updated.) You can specify the
                                   level of data recovery by using the /f\:
                                   n option.

 /f [:n]                           Specifies that the chkdsk utility is to
                                   correct errors it finds on the disk. If
                                   you do not specify this option, chkdsk
                                   does not correct any errors. The n
                                   argument is available only for HPFS. It
                                   specifies the level of data recovery and
                                   must be a number in the range 0 through
                                   3; the default level is 2. Level 0 is
                                   the same as not specifying /f at all. At
                                   level 1, chkdsk corrects inconsistencies,
                                   moves data in reserved sectors to the
                                   file-system data sectors, and updates
                                   all references to the sectors in
                                   file-system structures. These actions
                                   may create orphaned disk spaceÄthat is,
                                   space that was once occupied by corrupt
                                   files that have been removed by chkdsk
                                   but that is still marked "in use" in the
                                   disk-usage map. At level 2, chkdsk does
                                   everything included at level 1 and also
                                   recovers any recognizable structures
                                   from orphaned disk space. At level 3,
                                   chkdsk does everything included at level
                                   2 and also recovers any recognizable
                                   structures from anywhere in the disk
                                   partition. The higher the level of
                                   recovery you specify, the more thorough
                                   the recovery will be, but the longer it
                                   will take.

 /v                                Displays the name of each file in each
                                   directory as it is checked.

 If you type chkdsk by itself, the utility displays the status of the disk in
 the current drive. If you specify a filename but no drive (FAT file system
 only), chkdsk displays the status of the disk in the current drive and of
 the individual file.

 If you specify the /f option, the chkdsk utility reports an error if there
 are any open files on the disk. If you do not specify /f and there are open
 files, chkdsk may report that there are lost clusters on the disk. This
 happens when the disk's file-system table has not been updated regarding
 open files.

 When the chkdsk utility finds lost clusters on a disk, it displays a message
 asking you whether you want the lost clusters recovered. If you did not
 specify /f, answering Yes only shows what chkdsk would have done if you had
 specified /f, and answering No does nothing. If you did specify /f, however,
 answering Yes causes chkdsk to recover the lost clusters and store them in
 files named FILEnnnn.CHK, where nnnn is a consecutive number beginning from
 0001; answering No causes chkdsk to erase the lost clusters. If there are
 extended attributes in the lost clusters, chkdsk does not erase the lost
 clusters when you specify /f and answer No.

 If chkdsk finds errors in extended attributes, it places the recovered
 attributes in files named EAnnnn.CHK, where nnnn is a sequential number
 assigned by MS OS/2. You can look at these files by using the type command.
 If you can identify which of your files the extended attributes belong to,
 you can join the extended attributes to the file by using the eautil
 utility.

 Do not try to fix errors while you are using the multitasking features of MS
 OS/2, such as background printing or spooling.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Warning

 Do not run an older version of the chkdsk utility (earlier than MS OS/2
 version 1.2) on a disk or partition that contains extended attributes. You
 will lose the extended attributes, and you may corrupt the files on the
 partition.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Although you can use the chkdsk utility to get information about any drive,
 you cannot use it to fix errors on the drive from which you started your
 system or the drive from which you are running chkdsk. To check your
 start-up drive, you must run chkdsk from the MS OS/2 Install disk. You can
 do the same thing to check the drive from which you would normally run
 chkdsk, or you can copy the chkdsk utility to another drive and run it from
 there.

 For more information about interpreting chkdsk messages and about fixing
 errors on your start-up disk, see the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's
 Guide.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session that
 uses the FAT file system, except that the DOS version of the chkdsk utility
 displays the amount of memory used in the DOS session and you cannot run
 chkdsk on an HPFS partition from the DOS session.

 You cannot use the chkdsk utility on drives that you have assigned, joined,
 or substituted by using the "assign" , "join" , or "subst" utility. Example

 To check and fix errors on drive C, which is your start-up drive, insert the
 MS OS/2 Install disk in drive A, press CTL+ALT+DEL, press ESC when the logo
 appears, and type the following at the command prompt:

 chkdsk c: /f


 Cls (Clear Screen)

   ®OS2¯

 cls

 Clears the screen, leaving only the prompt and the cursor. If you are
 running "cmd" in a window, cls clears the contents of the window, including
 any information that is not currently visible.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.


 Cmd (MS OS/2 Command Interpreter)

   ®OS2¯

 cmd [drive:][path] [/s] [/c command(s)|/k command(s)]

 Starts a new MS OS/2 command interpreter.

 drive:path                        Specifies the location of CMDpath, MS
                                   OS/2 uses the path specified in your
                                   environment.

 /s                                Instructs the new command interpreter
                                   not to set up the signal handler.

 /ccommand(s)                      Instructs the new command interpreter to
                                   perform the command or commands
                                   specified and then return control to the
                                   command interpreter that called it. If
                                   you specify multiple commands, separate
                                   them with an ampersand (&).

 /kcommand(s)                      Instructs the new command interpreter to
                                   perform the command or commands
                                   specified and then continue to run. If
                                   you specify multiple commands, separate
                                   them with an ampersand (&).


 If you type cmd by itself, MS OS/2 starts the new command interpreter in the
 current session.

 When you start a command interpreter, you also create a command environment.
 This environment is a copy of the environment from which you started the
 command interpreter. You can change this new environment without affecting
 the old environment.

 For an alternative way to run cmd and have it start other commands, see the
 "start" command. Example

 To start cmd and have it check the disk in drive B and then end, type the
 following:

 cmd /c chkdsk b:


 Codepage

   ®CONFIG¯

 codepage=xxx[,yyy]

 Selects the code pages that the system will use. To use this command, place
 it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 xxx                               Specifies the first code page. This must
                                   be a three-digit number from the list
                                   that follows.

 yyy                               Specifies the optional second code page.
                                   This must be a three-digit number from
                                   the list that follows.

 If you specify two code pages, you can switch between them by using the
 "chcp" command.

 Code page, keyboard, and country are interrelated. A code page is a set of
 characters that are available to your system for use on the screen, for
 printing, and for sending to any other sort of output device. Your keyboard
 layout tells your system which characters from the character set correspond
 to which keystrokes; this can be different from country to country. The
 country you are working in (or for which you want to set up your system)
 determines which two code pages you should use. (For a list of country codes
 and their corresponding code pages, see the "country" command.) You can
 change keyboard layouts without having to change code pages.

 MS OS/2 supports the following four code pages:

 Code page                         Character set
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 437                               United States

 850                               Multilingual

 860                               Portuguese

 863                               Canadian French

 The United States code page (437) includes most of the characters needed for
 most Western European languages, but the Multilingual code page (850), which
 is also used by systems other than personal computers, is more versatile and
 more complete. You would usually want to specify code page 850 as the second
 code page, no matter what national code page you specified first. For tables
 of the character sets in the four code pages, see the Appendix, "Code Pages
 and Keyboard Layouts."

 If you are setting up a keyboard, screen, or printer to use code pages, you
 must also use the "devinfo" command to specify the code pages the outside
 device is to use. For more information, see the "devinfo" command. Example

 To set up your system to use code pages 437 and 850, include the following
 line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 codepage=437,850


 COM0x.SYS

   ®CONFIG¯

 device=[drive:][path]com0x.sys

 Directs MS OS/2 to load the COM0x.SYS device driver, which allows you to use
 your system's serial communications port. To use this command, place it in
 your CONFIG.SYS file.

 x                                 Specifies the communications-port device
                                   driver to load. For an IBM PC/AT or
                                   compatible computer, x must be 1. For an
                                   IBM PS/2 or compatible computer, x must
                                   be 2.

 Example

 To direct MS OS/2 to load the communications-port driver for your IBM PC/AT
 or compatible computer, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\com01.sys

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 To use a serial Microsoft Mouse on an IBM PC/AT or compat- ible computer,
 you must list the mouse drivers in your CONFIG.SYS file before any COM01.SYS
 device driver, as follows:
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 device=c:\eos2\emsser01.sys
 device=c:\eos2\emouse.sys type=msser$
 device=c:\eos2\ecom01.sys


 Command

   ®DOS¯

 command [drive:][path] [/c command|/p] [/e:size]

 Starts a secondary DOS command interpreter in the DOS session.

 drive:path                        Specifies the location of COMMANDpath,
                                   MS OS/2 uses the path specified in your
                                   environment.

 /ccommand                         Instructs the secondary command
                                   interpreter to perform the command
                                   specified and then return control to the
                                   primary command interpreter.

 /p                                Instructs the secondary command
                                   interpreter to stay in memory. This
                                   disables the "exit"command; you must
                                   restart your system in order to remove
                                   the secondary command interpreter. Each
                                   secondary command interpreter uses a
                                   portion of your system's available
                                   memory, so running a secondary command
                                   interpreter leaves less memory available
                                   for running other programs in the DOS
                                   session.

 /e:size                           Specifies the size of the DOS
                                   environment, in bytes. This number must
                                   be in the range 160 through 32,768; the
                                   system rounds it up to a multiple of 16.
                                   The default value is 160.

 When you start a command interpreter, you also create a command environment.
 This environment is a copy of the environment from which you started the
 command interpreter. You can change the new environment without affecting
 the old environment. To quit the secondary command interpreter, use the exit
 command. Example

 To start a secondary DOS command interpreter and have it check the disk in
 drive B and then return to the primary command interpreter, type the
 following:

 command /c chkdsk b:


 Comp (Compare)

   ®OS2¯

 comp [drive:][path][filename1] [drive:][path][filename2]

 Compares two files or sets of files to see whether they are the same.

 filename1                         Specifies the name of the first file.

 filename2                         Specifies the name of the second file.
                                   If filename2 is the same as filename1
                                   except that the file is on a different
                                   drive, you can type only the drive
                                   letter of the second file.

 If you specify only a path or a drive, without any filename, the comp
 utility assumes that you want to compare all the files in that directory or
 on that drive.

 If you type comp by itself, the utility prompts you for the filenames. You
 can use wildcard characters to specify a group of files.

 If the files found in one directory differ in size from the files found in
 the other directory, comp displays a message asking if you want to continue.
 If the files are the same size but their contents differ, comp automatically
 displays the location and contents of each nonmatching byte.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Examples

 To compare each file with the extension .DOC in the current directory on
 drive C with each file of the same name with the extension .BAK on drive B,
 type the following:

 comp c:*.doc b:*.bak

 To compare the files in the root directory on drive A with the contents of
 the TEMP directory on drive C, type the following:

 comp a: c:\temp

 To compare the contents of the SALES directory with the current directory,
 type the following:

 comp \sales .


 Copy

   ®OS2¯

 copy source [/a|/b] [+ source [/a|/b] [...]] destination [/a|/b] [/v] [/f]


 Copies information from a source to a destination. The source is usually a
 file or files, but it can also be a drive or directory or the output of a
 device (such as the keyboard); the destination can be one or more files or a
 device.

 source                            Specifies where the information will be
                                   copied from. If the source is a file, MS
                                   OS/2 assumes that the file is in the
                                   current directory on the current drive,
                                   unless you tell it otherwise by
                                   specifying a drive and path. The source
                                   can also be a drive or a directory. You
                                   can copy multiple files by using
                                   wildcard characters. You can copy
                                   multiple source files to one destination
                                   file by specifying multiple source-file
                                   names separated by plus signs (+). If
                                   the source is a device, MS OS/2 takes
                                   the input from that device and copies it
                                   to the destination.

 destination                       Specifies where the information will be
                                   copied to. The destination can be a
                                   single file, or you can use wildcard
                                   characters to specify a group of files.
                                   The destination can also be a directory
                                   or a device. If you specify only a drive
                                   as the destination, MS OS/2 copies to
                                   the current directory on that drive; if
                                   you do not specify a drive, MS OS/2 uses
                                   the current drive. If the destination is
                                   a file that does not already exist, MS
                                   OS/2 creates a new file; if the file
                                   already exists, MS OS/2 writes over the
                                   old file.

 /a                                Treats the source or destination as
                                   ASCII text. This option applies to the
                                   filename preceding it and to all
                                   remaining filenames in the command until
                                   MS OS/2 encounters a /b option, in which
                                   case the /b option applies to the
                                   filename that precedes it. When /a comes
                                   after the source, MS OS/2 copies
                                   everything up to the first CTRL+Z
                                   character, which it interprets as an
                                   end-of-file mark, and does not copy
                                   anything after that. When /a comes after
                                   the destination, MS OS/2 adds an
                                   end-of-file character as the last
                                   character of the destination file. When
                                   you are copying multiple files to one
                                   destination, the default option is
                                   always /a.

 /b                                Treats the source or destination as a
                                   binary file. This option applies to the
                                   filename preceding it and to all
                                   remaining filenames in the command until
                                   MS OS/2 encounters a /a option, in which
                                   case the /a option applies to the
                                   filename that precedes it. When /b comes
                                   after the source, MS OS/2 copies
                                   everything and does not interpret any
                                   CTRL+Z characters as end-of-file marks.
                                   When /b comes after the destination
                                   filename, MS OS/2 does not add an
                                   end-of-file character to the new file.

 /v                                Checks whether the sectors the
                                   information was copied to can be read.

 /f                                Specifies that MS OS/2 should not
                                   discard the extended attributes of a
                                   file if the destination file system does
                                   not support extended attributes. In this
                                   case, MS OS/2 does not copy the file.

 When you use the copy command to append files to an existing file without
 changing the existing filename (including its extension), you must specify
 that filename as the first source file, followed by the names of the files
 you want to append.

 When you copy a single file to a new file, the new file has the same date
 and time as the original. When you combine files into a new file, the new
 file has the current date and time.

 When you use the copy command to make a copy of an existing file, MS OS/2
 copies the extended attributes of that file to the new file. When you use
 copy to append files to an existing file, the extended attributes of the
 existing file do not change. When you append files to a new file, the new
 file uses the extended attributes of the first of the appended files.

 If you omit the /f option when you copy a file with extended attributes to a
 file system that does not support extended attributes, MS OS/2 copies the
 file and discards the extended attributes. If the file requires the extended
 attributes, MS OS/2 does not copy the file but displays an explanatory
 message on the screen.

 To copy files that have long filenames from an HPFS disk or partition to a
 FAT disk or partition, you must either give the files new names in the FAT
 filename format (xxxxxxxx.xxx) or use File Manager.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Examples

 To copy the file COMPANY.NEW in the current directory on the current drive
 to the CUSTOMER directory on the disk in drive B, type the following:

 copy company.new b:\ecustomer

 To copy all the files in the directory REPORTS on your hard disk (drive C)
 to the disk in drive A, type the following:

 copy c:\ereports\e* a:

 To combine the files INTRO.RPT, BODY.RPT, and SUM.RPT from the current drive
 and directory and place them in a file called REPORT on the disk in drive B,
 type the following:

 copy intro.rpt + body.rpt + sum.rpt b:report

 If you omit the destination-file name, MS OS/2 combines the files and stores
 them under the name of the first file specified.

 To combine all files from the current drive and directory that have the
 extension .TXT into one file named COMBIN.DOC in the same directory, type
 the following:

 copy *.txt combin.doc

 To combine each file from the current drive and directory that has the
 extension .TXT with the corresponding file that has the extension .REF and
 place the results into files with the extension .DOC (for example, VIDEO.TXT
 and VIDEO.REF would be combined as VIDEO.DOC), type the following:

 copy *.txt + *.ref *.doc

 To copy what you type at the keyboard (CON) to the file TEXT.TXT, type the
 following:

 copy con text.txt

 After typing your text, press CTRL+Z and then press ENTER to complete the
 command.


 Country

   ®CONFIG¯

 country=xxx[,[drive:][path]filename]

 Specifies the country for which MS OS/2 is to set up the system. To use this
 command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 xxx                               Specifies the country by using a
                                   three-digit country code from the list
                                   that follows. You must include all three
                                   digits, even if the code begins with a
                                   zero. The default setting is 001 (United
                                   States).

 filename                          Specifies the file that contains
                                   information on country conventions and
                                   supported code pages. If you do not
                                   specify a drive or path, MS OS/2 looks
                                   for this file in the root directory of
                                   the startup drive. If you do not specify
                                   filename, MS OS/2 uses the default
                                   COUNTRY.SYS file in the root directory
                                   of the drive from which you started MS
                                   OS/2.

 The country you choose determines the MS OS/2 conventions for such things as
 time and date format, decimal separators, and the order in which the "sort"
 utility sorts ASCII characters. The country you specify with the country
 command also determines which code pages you should specify with the
 "codepage" command.

 The following list shows the countries or languages that you can specify
 with the country command, the corresponding country codes, and the code
 pages supported for each country:

 Note

 Although not shown in the list, the following code pages are also available
 with special versions of MS OS/2: Arabic, Asia, Hebrew, Japan, Korea,
 People's Republic of China, and Taiwan.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 In the preceding list, the first of the two code pages for each country is
 the default code page for that country. If you do not include the "codepage"
 command in your CONFIG.SYS file, MS OS/2 uses the system default code page.
 Example

 To set up your system for the Netherlands and instruct MS OS/2 to look for
 COUNTRY.SYS in the OS2 directory on the disk in drive A, include the
 following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 country=031,a:\eos2\ecountry.sys


 Createdd (Create Dump Disk)

   ®OS2¯

 createdd drive:

 Prepares a disk that can be used to copy the contents of memory.

 drive:                            Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   disk to be used for copying memory
                                   contents.

 A copy of memory contents may be helpful in identifying system problems. To
 copy memory contents to a disk, insert the disk prepared by using createdd
 into the disk drive and press CTRL+ALT+NUMLOCK twice. If there is more
 information in memory than can fit on one disk, MS OS/2 prompts you to
 insert additional disks. These additional disks need only to have been
 formatted. After a disk is full, you receive summary information for that
 disk and MS OS/2 prompts you to insert another disk. When the copying
 operation is completed, MS OS/2 prompts you to reinsert the disk created by
 using createdd. The system then stops, and you must restart it.

 Do not start the copying operation while the hard disk is being read from or
 written to. This could disrupt directory information on the hard disk,
 causing files to be lost. Example

 To prepare a disk in drive A for copying memory contents, type the
 following:

 createdd a:


 Date

   ®OS2¯

 date [month-day-year]

 Sets the system calendar by specifying the current date.

 month                             Specifies a number in the range 1
                                   through 12.

 day                               Specifies a number in the range 1
                                   through 31.

 year                              Specifies a four-digit number in the
                                   range 1980 through 2079. You can
                                   abbreviate this number by using the last
                                   two digits of the year, in the range 80
                                   through 79.

 You can use slashes (/) or periods (.) instead of hyphens (-) to separate
 the month, day, and year.

 If you type date by itself, MS OS/2 displays the current date and then
 prompts you for a new date. If you don't want to change the date, just press
 ENTER.

 If you have used the "country" configuration command in your CONFIG.SYS file
 to alter the date format (for instance, to specify a date as
 day-month-year), the date command reflects that change.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To set the system date to May 1, 2017, type the following:

 date 5-1-17


 Ddinstal (Install Device Driver)

   ®OS2¯

 ddinstal

 Provides an automated way to install new devices and their device drivers on
 your system without running the MS OS/2 installation program again. The
 ddinstal utility copies the device driver to your system and adds the
 appropriate "device" command to your CONFIG.SYS file.

 To install a device by using the ddinstal utility, type ddinstal and press
 ENTER. The utility prompts you to insert the disk that contains the device
 driver to be installed. Then simply follow the instructions on the screen to
 complete the installation.


 Del (Delete or Erase)

   ®OS2¯

 del [drive:][path]filename [...] [/p]

 Deletes a file or group of files. You can type erase instead of del if you
 prefer; they both have the same effect.

 filename                          Specifies the name of the file to be
                                   deleted. You can use wildcard characters
                                   to delete more than one file in a
                                   directory; you can also specify more
                                   than one file by typing the filenames
                                   individually, separated by spaces.

 /p                                Asks you for confirmation before
                                   deleting each file.

 You can type del * to delete all the files in the current directory. (You
 cannot, however, delete the directory itself by using del.) To delete all
 the files in another directory, type only del followed by the directory
 name. To prevent you from accidentally deleting important files, MS OS/2
 displays a message like the following when you type either of the preceding
 commands:

 C:\*.*, Are you sure (Y/N)?

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Warning

 Once you have deleted a file from your disk, it is gone; you cannot recover
 it. Be sure you have specified the right file or files, with the correct
 path, before you press ENTER.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 If you are deleting a group of files and MS OS/2 cannot delete one of them
 (for example, if one of the files you specified does not exist), it deletes
 the rest of the files in the group and then displays an error message
 identifying the file it could not delete and the reason.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that in the DOS session you cannot specify multiple filenames. You can,
 however, use wildcard characters to delete more than one file in the same
 directory. Example

 To delete all the files in the current directory of drive C that have the
 extension .BAK, and to delete the file OLDSTUFF.DOC in the directory MEMOS
 on drive B, type the following:

 del c:*.bak b:\ememos\eoldstuff.doc


 Detach

   ®OS2¯

 detach command [options]

 Detaches a process to run in the background while you go on to another task.


 command                           Specifies any MS OS/2 program or command
                                   that does not require you to type input
                                   from the keyboard.

 options                           Specifies any valid options that the
                                   program or command can accept in the
                                   command line.

 When you detach a process, MS OS/2 starts it as an independent process,
 displays the process identification (PID) number, and immediately displays
 the MS OS/2 prompt. You can then type other commands while the detached
 process is running in the background.

 You should not detach programs that require keyboard input.

 You can run programs in the background sequentially by listing their names
 in order, separated by ampersands (&).

 You cannot stop a detached process; it must complete itself on its own. If
 you delete the parent process (quit the command interpreter, for instance),
 the detached process still runs until it is finished.

 If you try to detach a program that should not be run in the background, you
 could ruin files or lose valuable information. The documentation for the
 program should tell you whether it can be detached safely. Examples

 To create an alphabetically sorted listing of the SORT.IN file and put it in
 a file called SORT.OUT, and to have this process run in the background so
 that you can run another process while it is sorting, type the following:

 detach sort < sort.in > sort.out

 To copy all the files from the current directory on the current drive to
 drive D and then place the directory listing in FILES.LST, and to have these
 processes run in the background, type the following:

 detach copy * d: & dir d: > files.lst


 Device

   ®CONFIG¯

 device=[drive:][path]filename [arguments]

 Instructs MS OS/2 to load the specified device driver. To use this command,
 place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 filename                          Specifies the name of the file that
                                   contains the device driver. If this file
                                   is not in the root directory of the
                                   start-up drive, you must include the
                                   drive and/or path.

 arguments                         Specifies any valid options or other
                                   variables for the designated device
                                   driver.

 Each device connected to your system needs its own device driver, and each
 driver requires a separate device command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 You generally receive a device driver on a disk when you buy a new device;
 be sure that you place the device driver in the directory you specify with
 the device command.

 MS OS/2 processes device commands in the order in which they appear in your
 CONFIG.SYS file and before it processes any "run" commands in the file.
 Example

 To use the InPort(R) model of the Microsoft Mouse and specify that the
 device driver is in the OS2 directory on your hard disk (drive C), include
 the following lines in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\eos2\emsinp01.sys
 device=c:\eos2\emouse.sys type=msinp$
 device=c:\eos2\epointdd.sys


 Devinfo (Device Information)

   ®CONFIG¯

 devinfo=devtype,subtype,[drive:][path]filename [,ROM=[[(
 ]xxx[,yyy)]][,...]]

 Prepares a device to use code pages. To use this command, place it in your
 CONFIG.SYS file.

 devtype                           Specifies the type of device: keyboard,
                                   monitor, or parallel printer. See the
                                   list on the next page for possible
                                   values.

 subtype                           Specifies the style or model of the
                                   device. For a keyboard, this argument
                                   would specify the keyboard layout. See
                                   the list below for possible values.

 filename                          Specifies the file that contains
                                   information about the code pages for
                                   that device. See the list below for
                                   possible values.

 ROM=                              Specifies that code pages are available
                                   to a printer, either in the printer's
                                   read-only memory or in a cartridge. This
                                   and the following options apply only to
                                   parallel printers.

 xxx                               Specifies a code page that is available
                                   for a parallel printer. Each code page
                                   is identified by a three-digit number;
                                   for a list of the possible code pages,
                                   see the "codepage"command. A printer may
                                   support more than one code page.

 yyy                               Specifies a font identification number
                                   that identifies a font on a parallel
                                   printer and associates that font with a
                                   particular code page. A code page may
                                   have more than one font associated with
                                   it. See your printer manual for font
                                   identification numbers.

 You must include a separate devinfo command in your CONFIG.SYS file for each
 device connected to your system, including the keyboard and the monitor, if
 you want to be able to switch code pages. The devinfo command specifies the
 kind of device you have connected to your system and the location of the
 code-page or keyboard information for that device.

 The MS OS/2 installation program automatically places certain devinfo
 commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.

  The following list shows the values you can give to devtype, subtype, and
 filename:

 Argument                          Keyboard    Monitor        Printer
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

                                                              LPT#, LPT4

 subtype                           keyboard    EGA, VGA       4201, 5202

                                   CP                         5202.DCP


 Keyboard code is a two-letter code that identifies the keyboard layout for a
 particular country. For a list of the possible keyboard codes, see the
 "keyb" utility. Examples

 To prepare your keyboard to use the code pages you have specified with the
 "codepage" command, to use the United Kingdom keyboard layout, and to
 specify that the file containing code-page information is in the OS2
 directory on your hard disk (drive C), include the following line in your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 devinfo=kbd,uk,c:\eos2\ekeyboard.dcp

 To prepare an IBM Quietwriter III to use code pages 437 and 850, with
 multiple fonts, include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file (type
 this as a single line, even though it appears here on more than one line):

 devinfo=lpt1,5202,5202.dcp,rom=(437,011),
 (437,085),(437,254),(437,159),(850,254),
 (850,159)


 Dir (Directory)

   ®OS2¯

 dir [drive:][path][filename] [...] [/p] [/w | /f] [/n]

 Displays a list of the files on a disk or in a directory, with information
 about the size of each file and when it was created, the number of files in
 the directory, and the number of bytes free on the disk.

 path                              Specifies the directory whose listing
                                   you want to display.

 filename                          Specifies a particular file whose
                                   listing you want to display. If you
                                   specify a filename, MS OS/2 displays
                                   information about that file alone. You
                                   can use wildcard characters to get
                                   information about groups of files with
                                   similar namesÄfor example, to compare
                                   the dates and sizes of several files
                                   with the same extension.

 /p                                Displays the listing one screenful at a
                                   time.

 /w                                Lists only the filenames (including
                                   their extensions) and displays them
                                   across the width of the screen in
                                   several columns. If you are using a file
                                   system that recognizes long filenames,
                                   the width of the columns is determined
                                   by the length of the longest filename.
                                   This option cannot be used with the /f
                                   option.

 /f                                Lists the drive, path, and filename
                                   (including extension) for each file
                                   specified, but does not display any
                                   other information about the file. This
                                   option cannot be used with the /w option.

 /n                                (FAT file system only) Displays the
                                   listing in the format used in HPFS, with
                                   the filename in the right-hand column
                                   and an additional column showing the
                                   size of each file's extended attributes.

 You can specify several drives, paths, or filenames. For each different
 drive or directory you specify, MS OS/2 displays a separate list of files.
 If, however, you specify more than one file or group of files in the same
 directory, MS OS/2 displays them in a single list for that directory.

 If you type dir by itself, MS OS/2 displays information about all the files
 in the current directory on the current drive.

 If you are displaying directory listings for several directories or disks
 (or for several files specified individually) and MS OS/2 cannot display a
 listing for one of them (for example, if one of the directories does not
 exist), it displays an error message for that file, directory, or disk, and
 continues displaying the rest of the listings.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that in the DOS session you cannot specify multiple directories or
 filenames. You can, however, use wildcard characters in filenames.

 Example

 To display a list of all the files in the LETTERS directory on drive C and a
 list of all the files with the extension .LTR in the OFFICE directory on
 drive B, and to display them as short, wide lists across the screen, type
 the following:

 dir c:\eletters b:\eoffice\e*.ltr /w


 Diskcache

   ®CONFIG¯

 diskcache=n[,m]

 Enables disk caching for the FAT file system and specifies the amount of
 memory to be set aside for the disk cache. To use this command, place it in
 your CONFIG.SYS file.

 n                                 Specifies the amount of memory, in
                                   kilobytes, to be set aside for the disk
                                   cache. This number must be in the range
                                   64 through 7200.

 m                                 Specifies the disk-cache threshold value,
                                   in sectors. If the data exceeds m
                                   sectors, MS OS/2 does not store it in
                                   the disk cache. This value must be in
                                   the range 1 through 32; the default
                                   value is 7.

 A disk cache is an extra buffer in which MS OS/2 stores information that it
 has recently read from your hard disk. When an application needs to read
 information from the hard disk, it looks first in the disk cache to see if
 the information is there. Since it is much faster to read from the disk
 cache than to read from the hard disk, disk caching can speed up your
 system. However, the disk cache uses part of system memory, so less memory
 is available to an application.

 MS OS/2 uses part of the memory set aside for the disk cache for control
 information. The amount of memory required for control information depends
 on the size of your hard disk.

 To change the size of the disk cache, change the diskcache command in your
 CONFIG.SYS file and then restart your system.

 You should not use the diskcache configuration command if your system has a
 partition that uses the high-performance file system (HPFS), because it
 slows the performance of HPFS. Example

 To set aside 128 kilobytes of memory for disk caching, include the following
 line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 diskcache=128


 Diskcomp (Disk Compare)

   ®OS2¯

 diskcomp [drive1:] [drive2:]

 Compares two floppy disks track by track.

 drive1:                           Specifies the drive letter of the first
                                   disk being compared.

 drive2:                           Specifies the drive letter of the second
                                   disk being compared.

 Since the diskcomp utility automatically determines the number of sides and
 sectors per track by looking at the format of the first disk, both disks
 must be of the same type (for instance, high-density 5inch disks).

 If you specify only one drive, diskcomp compares the floppy disk in drive1
 with the floppy disk in the current drive. If you specify the same drive for
 both drive1 and drive2, diskcomp uses only that drive and prompts you to
 change disks as needed during the comparison. If you type diskcomp by
 itself, the utility uses only the current drive and prompts you to insert
 the two disks, as appropriate. (If the current drive is not a floppy-disk
 drive, you see an error message.)

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 You cannot use the diskcomp utility on drives that you have assigned,
 joined, or substituted by using the "assign" , "join" , or "subst" utility.
 Example

 To compare two high-density floppy disks when you have only one high-density
 disk drive (drive A), type the following:

 diskcomp a: a:

 The diskcomp utility prompts you to insert each disk in turn, as needed,
 during the comparison.


 Diskcopy

   ®OS2¯

 diskcopy [drive1:] [drive2:]

 Makes a duplicate of a floppy disk.

 drive1:                           Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   floppy disk to be copied (the source
                                   disk).

 drive2:                           Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   floppy disk that will become the
                                   duplicate (the destination disk).

 The two disks must be of the same type (for example, high-density 5-inch
 floppy disks). If the destination disk is unformatted, diskcopy formats it
 with the same number of sides and sectors per track as the source disk.

 You can copy a disk using only one drive, either by not specifying any
 drives or by specifying the same drive for both source and destination.
 Diskcopy prompts you to insert the two disks as needed. If you type diskcopy
 by itself, the utility uses the current drive.

 Diskcopy writes over the information on the destination disk, even if it
 does not have to format the disk, so any information that is already on the
 disk is lost.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 You cannot use the diskcopy utility on drives that you have assigned,
 joined, or substituted by using the "assign" , "join" , or "subst" utility.
 Example

 To copy the floppy disk in drive A to a floppy disk in drive B, type the
 following:

 diskcopy a: b:


 Dpath (Data Path)

   ®OS2¯

 dpath [;|[drive:]path[;...]]

 Specifies which directories besides the current directory an application
 should search in order to find data files (files with extensions other than

 ;                                 When used alone (dpath ;), clears all
                                   data-path settings. Semicolons are also
                                   used to separate multiple data paths.

 path                              Specifies the path of the directory that
                                   you want the application to search. You
                                   can specify more than one path,
                                   separating them with semicolons (;).

 If you type dpath by itself, MS OS/2 displays the current data path.

 Each time you use the dpath command, the new data path you specify takes the
 place of the previous path. The data path is stored in the MS OS/2
 environment. Only applications that are written to take advantage of dpath
 will use the data path specified.

 The dpath command affects only the current session. To specify a data path
 for all sessions, you must set the DPATH environment variable in your
 CONFIG.SYS file. For information about how to do this, see the "set"
 command.

 If you start a new command interpreter from within a session where dpath is
 defined, the new session inherits the dpath setting. You can change this
 setting in the new session without affecting the settings in the parent
 session.

 The dpath command works much the way the "path" command does, except that
 dpath is used by an application to search for data files, whereas "path" is
 used by commands and utilities outside of applications.

 The dpath command achieves the same results in an OS/2 session as the
 "append" utility does in the DOS session. Example

 To instruct an application to search for data files in the SYMPHONY
 directory and the COUNTRY subdirectory of the BANDS directory on the current
 drive, and in the ROCK subdirectory of the BANDS directory on drive B, type
 the following:

 dpath \symphony;\bands\country;b:\bands\rock


 Eautil

   ®OS2¯

 eautil [/s [/r] [/p] | /j [/o | /m] [/p]] filename [holdfile]

 Deletes or copies (splits) the extended attributes from a data file or
 directory and stores them in a separate file, or copies (joins) the extended
 attributes back to the original data file or directory. The eautil utility
 enables applications that do not recognize extended attributes to manipulate
 files and directories without losing their extended attributes. The utility
 also enables you to send files over a network or copy them to systems that
 do not recognize extended attributes without losing their extended
 attributes.

 filename                          Specifies the data file or directory to
                                   copy the extended attributes from or
                                   back to.

 holdfile                          Specifies the file to store the extended
                                   attributes in or copy them back from. If
                                   you do not specify a filename for
                                   holdfile when splitting extended
                                   attributes, the eautil utility creates a
                                   file with the same name as filename and
                                   stores it in a directory named EAS. If
                                   you do not specify a filename for
                                   holdfile when joining extended
                                   attributes, eautil looks in the EAS
                                   directory for a file with the same name
                                   as filename.

 When you use the eautil utility to split the extended attributes from a file
 or directory, you use the /s option. When you specify /s, you can also
 specify the /r and /p options.

 /s                                Copies the extended attributes from
                                   filename to holdfile. This is the
                                   default option.

 /r                                Replaces the contents of holdfile with
                                   the extended attributes currently
                                   attached to filename. This option is
                                   used with the /s option. If holdfile
                                   already exists, you must specify the /r
                                   option in order to copy the extended
                                   attributes from filename; otherwise, the
                                   operation will fail.

 /p                                When used with the /s option, preserves
                                   the extended attributes attached to
                                   filename. If this option is not set, the
                                   eautil utility deletes the extended
                                   attributes from filename after copying
                                   them to holdfile.

 When you use the eautil utility to join extended attributes to a file or
 directory, you use the /j option. When you specify /j, you can also specify
 the /o or /m option and the /p option. If you specify the /j option and
 there are already extended attributes attached to filename, you must specify
 either the /o or /m option or the operation will fail.

 /j                                Copies the extended attributes from
                                   holdfile back to filename.

 /o                                Overwrites the extended attributes
                                   attached to filename, replacing them
                                   with the extended attributes in holdfile.
                                   This option is used with the /j option.
                                   You cannot specify the /o option with
                                   the /m option.

 /m                                Adds (merges) the extended attributes in
                                   holdfile to those in filename. This
                                   option is used with the /j option. You
                                   cannot specify the /m option with the /o
                                   option.

 /p                                When used with the /j option, preserves
                                   holdfile after the extended attributes
                                   in it have been copied to filename. If
                                   the /p option is not set, the eautil
                                   utility deletes holdfile after joining
                                   the extended attributes to filename.


 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If your system crashes while you are running the eautil utility, the
 splitting or joining operation may be incomplete. If you were splitting
 extended attributes from a file or directory, you may have complete extended
 attributes in one location and incomplete ones in the other, but you won't
 know whether it is filename or holdfile that contains the complete set. To
 find out, run eautil again, specifying a different name for holdfile; then
 compare the sizes of the two holdfiles. The larger file contains the
 complete extended attributes, and you can delete the smaller file.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 If you were joining extended attributes to a file or directory when the
 system crashed, the extended attributes in filename may be incomplete. To
 remedy this, simply run eautil again and use the /o (overwrite) option (even
 if you were using the /m option when the system crashed).
 Examples

 To delete the extended attributes from the file REPORT and store them in a
 new file called REPORTEA, so that you can safely copy both files to a system
 running DOS or a version of MS OS/2 earlier than 1.2 without losing the
 extended attributes, type the following:

 eautil /s report reportea

 To copy the extended attributes from the file REPORTEA back to the file
 REPORT after you have copied both files to a system running MS OS/2 version
 1.2, type the following:

 eautil /j report reportea


 Echo

   ®OS2¯

 echo [on|off|message]

 Turns on or off the feature that displays batch-file commands on the screen
 while they are being processed, or simply displays the specified message on
 the screen. Although the echo command can be used from the command prompt,
 it is designed to be placed in a batch file.

 message                           Specifies a line of text to be displayed.

 If you type echo by itself, MS OS/2 displays the current setting.

 Ordinarily, MS OS/2 displays (echoes) commands in a batch file on the screen
 when it receives them. You can turn off this feature by specifying echo off
 in the batch file; none of the subsequent lines appear on the screen until
 MS OS/2 encounters an echo on command. You can also turn off the echoing of
 any individual command in a batch file, including the echo off command, by
 preceding the command with the @ symbol.

 You can display a message from a batch file (whether the echo feature is
 turned on or off) by specifying echo message in the file. If you want to
 display a message of more than one line, you must start each line with echo.


   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in a DOS batch file (.BAT extension) as it does in an
 OS/2 batch file (

 Example

 To turn the echo feature off and then have a batch file display the message
 "This batch file formats and checks new disks.", type the following in the
 batch file:

 @echo off
 echo This batch file formats and checks
 echo new disks.


 Edlin (Line Editor)

   ®DOS¯

 edlin [drive:][path] filename

 Lets you create and edit text files.

 filename                          Specifies the name of the file you want
                                   to create or edit.

 The edlin utility is a line-oriented text editor with a set of single-letter
 commands. Each line of text is preceded by a number, which you use to
 reference that line in the text file. Edlin accepts up to 254 characters per
 line.

 Once started, the edlin utility displays an asterisk as a prompt. You type
 commands at the prompt to insert, delete, change, copy, or move lines within
 the file. If you are working in a file, you can return to the asterisk
 prompt by pressing CTRL+C. In addition to using the edlin commands, you can
 also use the MS OS/2 editing keys to edit individual lines.

 You can use the following symbols to reference a line number or range of
 line numbers:

 Symbol                            Meaning
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 #                                 Specifies the line after the last line
                                   in the file.

 .                                 Specifies the current line.

 + or -                            Specifies a line relative to the current
                                   line; for example, \+3 means three lines
                                   past the current line.

 The following list summarizes the edlin commands:

 Command                           Purpose
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 line                              Edits the line number or numbers
                                   specified.

 a                                 Appends lines from disk to memory.

 c                                 Copies lines.

 d                                 Deletes lines.

 e                                 Ends the editing session and saves edits.

 i                                 Inserts lines of text.

 L or l                            Lists a range of lines.

 m                                 Moves a range of text to a specified
                                   line.

 p                                 Pages through a file 23 lines at a time.

 q                                 Ends the editing session without saving
                                   edits.

 r                                 Replaces text.

 s                                 Searches for text.

 t                                 Transfers the contents of another file
                                   into the file being edited.

 w                                 Writes specified lines from memory to
                                   disk.

 For details about using the edlin utility, see your DOS manual.


 Endlocal

   ®OS2¯

 endlocal

 Restores the drive, directory, and environment settings that were in effect
 before the "setlocal" command changed them. Use this command only in a batch
 file.

 You can use multiple "setlocal" commands in a batch file without including
 corresponding "endlocal" commands; each succeeding "setlocal" overrides the
 previous one, in effect acting as an "endlocal" command for the previous
 setlocal. If there is no endlocal command after the last "setlocal" command
 in a batch file, MS OS/2 restores the original drive, directory, and
 environment settings when the batch file ends.

 You can use this command only in OS/2 batch files (files with the extension
 Example

 To use "setlocal" in a batch file to set an alternative search path for
 certain commands to use, and to reset the original path after those commands
 are finished, type the following lines in the batch file:

 setlocal
 path c:\etest;a:\etemp
   .
   .
   .
 endlocal


 Erase

 See "del" .


 Exit

   ®OS2¯

 exit

 Ends the current command interpreter and returns control to the program from
 which it was started.

 If you have used "cmd" to start another MS OS/2 command interpreter, the
 exit command ends that command interpreter and returns you to the parent
 command interpreter. If you type exit from the parent command interpreter,
 the OS/2 session ends.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that in the DOS session exit ends the current DOS command interpreter (
 "command" ), unless it is the parent command interpreter. You cannot end the
 parent command interpreter.


 EXTDSKDD.SYS

   ®CONFIG¯

 device=[drive:][path]extdskdd.sys [/d:drive] [/t:tracks] [/s:sectors]
 [/h:heads] [/f:type]

 Directs MS OS/2 to load the EXTDSKDD.SYS device driver. To use this command,
 place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 When the EXTDSKDD.SYS device driver is loaded, you can access a floppy disk
 by using a logical drive letter. You can associate the letter with an
 external disk drive, or you can associate a second name (an alias) with an
 internal or external disk drive and copy to and from that same disk drive.

 /d:drive                          .LI Specifies the physical drive number.
                                   The number must be in the range 0
                                   through 255. The first physical
                                   floppy-disk drive (drive A) is drive 0;
                                   a second physical floppy-disk drive is
                                   drive 1; a third physical floppy-disk
                                   drive, which must be external, is drive
                                   2.

 /t:tracks                         .LI Specifies the number of tracks per
                                   side of a block device. The number must
                                   be in the range 1 through 999; the
                                   default value is 80.

 /s:sectors                        .LI Specifies the number of sectors per
                                   track. The number must be in the range 1
                                   through 99; the default value is 9.

 /h:heads                          .LI Specifies the number of disk
                                   read/write heads. The number must be in
                                   the range 1 through 99; the default
                                   value is 2.

 /f:type                           .LI Specifies the type of drive. This
                                   value must be 0 (160/180K or 320/360K),
                                   1 (1.2 megabyte), or 2 (720K, the
                                   default type).

 Examples

 To associate an alias with an internal 1.2-megabyte drive A, include the
 following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\extdskdd.sys /d:0 /t:80 /s:15 /h:2 /f:1

 To copy from the external disk drive to that same external drive, include
 the following lines in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\extdskdd.sys /d:2
 device=c:\os2\extdskdd.sys /d:2

 The first line associates the next available drive letter with the external
 disk drive. The second line associates an additional drive letter (an alias)
 with that same external drive.


 Extproc (External Batch Processor)

   ®OS2¯

 extproc [drive:][path]filename [options]

 Defines an external batch processor for a batch file. Use this command only
 in a batch file.

 filename                          Specifies the name of the file that
                                   contains the external batch processor.
                                   The filename must include the extension.
                                   You can also include a drive and a path,
                                   if necessary.

 options                           Specifies any valid options for the new
                                   batch processor.

 By putting this command as the first line of your batch file, you cause MS
 OS/2 to start a different batch processor and use that to run the batch
 file.

 You can use this command only in OS/2 batch files (files with the extension
 Example

 To run a batch file by using a batch processor called BORNEwhich is in the
 \BATCH directory on your hard disk (drive C), instead of by using "cmd" ,
 type the following as the first line of your batch file:

 extproc c:\batch\borne.exe


 Fcbs (File Control Blocks)

   ®CONFIG¯

 fcbs=x,y

 Specifies the number of file control blocks (FCBs) MS OS/2 can have open at
 one time and the number of those it cannot automatically close when too many
 FCBs are open. To use this command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 x                                 Specifies the maximum number of file
                                   control blocks that can be open at one
                                   time. This number must be in the range 1
                                   through 255; the default value is 16.

 y                                 Specifies the number of file control
                                   blocks that MS OS/2 cannot close
                                   automatically. This number must be in
                                   the range 0 through 255 and must be less
                                   than or equal to x; the default value is
                                   8.


 If a program tries to open more than x files by using file control blocks,
 MS OS/2 closes one of the open files in order to make room for each new one.
 MS OS/2 tries to close the least recently used file first, but the fcbs
 command protects the first y files against being closed.

 This command affects only the DOS session.

 File control blocks are an old method of managing files. You should use the
 fcbs command only if a DOS application requires you to do so. Example

 To specify that MS OS/2 can open only four files by using file control
 blocks and that it cannot close the first two of those files, include the
 following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 fcbs=4,2


 Fdisk /d (Delete Disk Partition)

   ®OS2¯

 fdisk /d

 Deletes the primary MS OS/2 partition, the extended partition, and any
 logical drives from the hard disk you start your system from.

 You must run this utility from the MS OS/2 Install disk.

 To create or delete partitions without deleting the primary MS OS/2
 partition on your start-up drive, use the Fixed Disk Utility application
 from Start Programs.


 Find

   ®OS2¯

 find [/v] [/c] [/n] "string" [[drive:][path][filename] [...]]

 Searches the file or files you specify, or the input you give it, for a
 specific string of text and displays all the instances of that string that
 it finds.

 /v                                Displays all lines that do not contain
                                   string.

 /c                                Displays only the total number of lines
                                   found that contain string.

 /n                                Displays each line that contains string,
                                   with a number in front of it that
                                   indicates its position within the file.

 string                            Specifies the group of alphanumeric
                                   characters you want to search for. You
                                   must enclose the string in double
                                   quotation marks (" "). Since the find
                                   utility is case-sensitive, you must type
                                   uppercase and lowercase letters exactly
                                   as you want the utility to search for
                                   them. If you are searching for a string
                                   that contains double quotation marks,
                                   you must use two double quotation marks
                                   for each double quotation mark that is
                                   part of the string..

 filename                          Specifies the file in which to search
                                   for string. If the file is not in the
                                   current directory of the current drive,
                                   you must also specify a drive and/or
                                   path. You cannot use wildcard characters
                                   when specifying filenames, but you can
                                   specify several files in one find
                                   operation. If you do not specify a
                                   filename, find searches standard input.

 If you specify /c with /v, the find utility displays the number of lines
 that do not contain string. If you specify /c with /n, find ignores /n.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To search for the string "I told him no, but did he listen?" in the files
 CHAPTER1.DOC and CHAPTER2.DOC on drive A, and to display the lines that
 contain the string along with their relative line numbers, type the
 following on one line:

 find /n "I told him no, but did he listen?"
 a:\echapter1.doc a:\echapter2.doc


 For

   ®OS2¯

 for [%]%x in (item [...] ) do command

 Performs a command for a set of files or other items that you specify.
 Although the for command can be used from the command prompt, it is designed
 to be placed in a batch file.

 %%x                               Specifies the variable that will be
                                   affected by command. The values of item
                                   are substituted sequentially for this
                                   variable. You can use any single letter
                                   or number for x.

 item                              Specifies a file or other item that you
                                   want to substitute for %%x so that
                                   command will affect it. You can specify
                                   multiple items, separated by spaces.
                                   These items are substituted sequentially
                                   for %%x. You can use wildcard characters
                                   in item names, and you can use
                                   replaceable parameters as items.

 command                           Specifies the command you want to
                                   perform on the items you have specified.
                                   This argument can be any MS OS/2 command
                                   or utility. You can also include any
                                   valid arguments for the command or
                                   utility that you specify.

 The for command substitutes the first item for the placeholder %%x and
 performs a command on that item; then for substitutes the second item for
 %%x and performs the command again; and so on until no items remain. If you
 use wildcard characters in an item name, the %%x is replaced once for each
 matching filename. For more information about replaceable parameters, see
 the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's Guide.

 If you use for directly from the command line, use only one percent sign in
 front of x (%x). In a batch file, however, you must use two percent signs,
 to distinguish this for variable from a replaceable parameter, which can be
 a number (%0-%9) or a string (%variable%).

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in a DOS batch file (.BAT extension) as it does in an
 OS/2 batch file (command or utility.

 Example

 To delete in turn each of the three files REPORT, MEMO, and ADDRESS, type
 the following in a batch file:

 for

 %%f in (report memo address) do del %%f


 Format

   ®OS2¯

 format drive: [/4] [/t:tracks] [/n:sectors] [/v:label] [/f:size]
 [/fs:filesystem]

 Prepares a disk or partition so that it can store MS OS/2 files.

 drive:                            Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   disk you want to format. This
                                   information is required.

 /4                                (FAT file system only) Formats a 5-inch,
                                   double-sided, low-density disk in a
                                   high-density drive. If you are using a
                                   low-density drive, you may not be able
                                   to reliably read disks formatted with
                                   this option.

 /t:tracks                         (FAT file system only) Formats a 3-inch
                                   disk to the number of tracks specified
                                   by tracks. The size of the specified
                                   drive determines the default value for
                                   tracks.

 /n:sectors                        (FAT file system only) Formats a 3-inch
                                   disk to the number of sectors specified
                                   by sectors. The size of the specified
                                   drive determines the default value for
                                   sectors.

 /v:label                          Specifies the volume labelÄa name used
                                   by programs to identify the disk. The
                                   label can be up to 11 characters. If you
                                   do not specify this option, the format
                                   utility prompts you for a volume label
                                   after formatting is complete. If the
                                   label includes blank spaces, you must
                                   enclose the label in double quotation
                                   marks.

 /f:size                           (FAT file system only) Specifies the
                                   memory capacity of a disk, in kilobytes
                                   (or, for a 1.2-megabyte or 1.44-megabyte
                                   disk, in megabytes). You can use this
                                   option instead of the /4, /t, and /n
                                   options, to simplify the process of
                                   formatting a floppy disk. The easiest
                                   way to specify size is as the number of
                                   kilobytes of memory on the disk (360,
                                   720, 1200, or 1440), but you can add an
                                   abbreviation (for example, 360K, 360KB,
                                   1.2M, 1.2MB) if you prefer.

 /fs:filesystem                    Specifies the file system for which to
                                   format the disk or partition. This can
                                   be any file system supported by MS OS/2.
                                   To format a disk or partition for the
                                   high-performance file system (HPFS),
                                   specify hpfs as the filesystem argument.
                                   When you use the /fs:hpfs option, the
                                   format utility adds the /autocheck:drive
                                   option to the end of the
                                   IFS=C:\OS2\HPFS.IFS /c:64 line in your
                                   CONFIG.SYS file. Whenever you
                                   subsequently restart your system, the
                                   /autocheck option causes MS OS/2 to run
                                   chkdsk /f for any HPFS drives that were
                                   shut down improperly.

 You must use the format utility to format all new disks so that MS OS/2 can
 use them. The format utility creates the directory and the file-system
 tables on the disk and assigns the disk a unique serial number. Format uses
 the drive type to determine the default format for the disk.

 You cannot format a disk that is in use, nor can you format your start-up
 disk or the disk that you started the format utility from.

 You cannot format a floppy disk for HPFS.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Warning

 The format utility erases all information that is already on the disk, so be
 sure you specify the correct drive.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that you cannot format a disk or partition for HPFS from the DOS session.

 You cannot use the format utility with drives that you have assigned,
 joined, or substituted by using the "assign" , "join" , or "subst" utility.
 Example

 To format a floppy disk in drive A and give it the label OLD LETTERS, type
 the following:

 format a: /v:"old letters"


 Goto

   ®OS2¯

 goto label

 Directs MS OS/2 to go to a particular line in a batch file and continue
 processing commands from that point. Use this command only in a batch file.

 label                             Specifies the location in the batch file
                                   where MS OS/2 should continue processing
                                   commands. Label can be any string you
                                   choose, but the goto command uses only
                                   the first eight valid characters to
                                   identify the label. Spaces, tabs, and
                                   certain common separators such as the
                                   equal sign (=) and the semicolon (;) are
                                   not valid characters in a label; it is
                                   best to use only letters and numbers.

 The specified label should appear on a line by itself, preceded by a colon
 (:); this line is ignored in batch processing, except as a marker for the
 goto command. The label line can be either before or after the goto command
 in the file.

 The goto command simply ignores invalid separators if they appear in the
 label line, but when it encounters a space or a tab, it stops reading the
 label. The following label lines, then, are equivalent:

 :lab
 :lab el
 :--lab el
 :==lab
 ==:;;lab el

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in a DOS batch file (.BAT extension) as it does in an
 OS/2 batch file (

 Example

 To format the disk in drive A and either go to the end of the file if no
 errors occur or display an error message if the formatting isn't completed
 successfully, type the following in a batch file:

 @echo off
 format a:
 if not errorlevel 1 goto end
 echo An error occurred during formatting.
 :end
 echo End of batch file.


 Graftabl (Graphics Table)

   ®DOS¯

 graftabl [xxx|?|/status]

 Loads the special graphics characters of an extended character set into
 memory so that your monitor can display these characters if you are using a
 display adapter in graphics mode.

 xxx                               Specifies the code page that defines the
                                   extended character set. This argument
                                   must be a three-digit number from the
                                   list that follows; the default code page
                                   is 437 (United States).

 ?                                 Displays the number of the active code
                                   page and a list of the available code
                                   pages.

 /status                           Displays the number of the active code
                                   page. You can abbreviate /status as /sta.

 The following code pages can be loaded by using the graftabl utility:

 Code                              Character set
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 437                               United States

 850                               Multilingual

 860                               Portuguese

 863                               Canadian French


 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Warning

 If you type graftabl by itself, the utility displays the number of the
 active code page, but it also automatically loads the default code page
 (437). Therefore, if you have a different code page loaded, typing graftabl
 by itself will identify that code page but also change it.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Example

 To enable MS OS/2 to display the special graphics characters of the
 Portuguese extended character set, type the following:

 graftabl 860


 Help

   ®OS2¯

 help [on|off |messageid | [document] topic]

 Displays Help information about MS OS/2 and about error or warning messages
 displayed in an OS/2 session or in the DOS session, or starts a Presentation
 Manager application that lets you view topics within an on-line reference
 document.

 on                                Displays a Help line at the top of your
                                   screen. This line tells you how to get
                                   help and how to get back to Desktop
                                   Manager. The help on command replaces
                                   your current prompt setting with the
                                   Help line and the current drive letter.

 off                               Removes the Help line from your screen.
                                   This is the default setting.

 messageid                         Identifies the particular Help message
                                   that you want more information about.
                                   The message identification number
                                   consists of three lettersÄfor example,
                                   SYSÄfollowed by a four-digit number. For
                                   system messages, you can also specify
                                   the number without the letters and
                                   leading zeros (for example, SYS0002 can
                                   be specified as 2).

 document                          Specifies the file that contains the
                                   reference document you want to view. If
                                   you do not specify a document, the help
                                   utility uses the OS/2 Command Reference.
                                   If you do not specify the filename
                                   extension, help uses the extension .INF.

 topic                             Specifies the topic you want to view
                                   information about. For the OS/2 Command
                                   Reference, this can be the name of a
                                   command or utility, or any other topic
                                   listed in the table of contents. If you
                                   specify document but do not specify
                                   topic, the help utility displays the
                                   table of contents of document. If you
                                   type only the first part of a topic name,
                                   help displays the first topic that
                                   matches the partial name.

 If you type help by itself, the utility displays a list of Help options and
 information.

 The MS OS/2 installation program places the following line in your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 set bookshelf=c:\os2\book

 The help utility searches for the document file in the directory specified
 in the BOOKSHELF environment variable. If you do not explicitly name the
 document, help searches each document in the directory for the topic. You
 can add other directories to the BOOKSHELF environment variable.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 To get more information about the error message "SYS0002: File not found",
 type the following:

 help sys0002

 MS OS/2 then displays the following information:

 SYS0002: The system cannot find the file specified.
 EXPLANATION: The file named in the command
 does not exist in the current directory or search path
 specified. Or, the file name was entered incorrectly.
 ACTION: Retry the command using the correct file name.

 To view the description of the "mode" command in the OS/2 Command Reference,
 type the following:

 help mode

 To view the description of MyTopic in the document file for an application
 named MyApp, which is in the directory MYDIR on your hard disk (drive C),
 type the following:

 help c:\mydir\myapp.inf mytopic


 If

   ®OS2¯

 if [not] condition command

 Directs MS OS/2 to carry out the given command only if the specified
 condition is met. If you include the word not, MS OS/2 carries out the
 command only if the condition is not met. Although the if command can be
 used from the command prompt, it is designed to be placed in a batch file.

 condition                         Specifies one of three conditions that
                                   determine whether MS OS/2 carries out
                                   the command:

                                   errorlevel numberWhen a program finishes,
                                   it sends an exit code to MS OS/2. If the
                                   exit code returned by the last program
                                   you ran was greater than or equal to
                                   number, MS OS/2 carries out the command.

                                   string1==string2If the first string is
                                   exactly the same as the second string,
                                   MS OS/2 carries out the command.
                                   Uppercase or lowercase is significant.
                                   The strings must not include separators
                                   such as commas, semicolons, equal signs,
                                   and spaces.

                                   exist [drive:][path] filenameIf the
                                   filename exists in the specified
                                   directory, MS OS/2 carries out the
                                   command. You can specify a drive and a
                                   path before filename; otherwise, MS OS/2
                                   looks for filename in the current
                                   directory.



 command                           Specifies the command to carry out if
                                   the given condition is met.


   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in a DOS batch file (.BAT extension) as it does in an
 OS/2 batch file (

 Example

 To display the message "Can't find data file" if the file BOOK.DAT does not
 exist in the current directory, type the following in a batch file:

 if not exist book.dat echo Can't find data file


 Ifs (Install File System)

   ®CONFIG¯

 ifs=[drive:][path]filename [/c[ache]:nnnn]

 Installs the driver for an installable file system and specifies the amount
 of memory to be reserved for disk caching. To use this command, place it in
 your CONFIG.SYS file.

 filename                          Specifies the name of the file that
                                   contains the file-system driver. If this
                                   file is not in the root directory of the
                                   start-up drive, you must include the
                                   drive and/or path.

 /c[ache]:nnnn                     (HPFS only) Specifies the amount of
                                   memory, in kilobytes, to be set aside
                                   for disk caching by the installable file
                                   system. You can abbreviate /cache as /c.
                                   The value of nnnn must be a number in
                                   the range 64 through 2048 and should be
                                   a multiple of 2, since HPFS divides the
                                   cache into 2-kilobyte blocks. If you
                                   specify an odd number when you are
                                   installing the HPFS driver, MS OS/2
                                   rounds it down to the next even number.
                                   The default cache size is either 64K or
                                   10 percent of the total available memory,
                                   whichever is greater.

 The ifs command should precede any "device" command in your CONFIG.SYS file,
 except "device" commands that load device drivers required by the
 installable file system. Example

 To set aside 500 kilobytes of memory for HPFS disk caching, include the
 following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 ifs=c:\os2\hpfs.ifs /c:500


 Iopl (Input/Output Privilege)

   ®CONFIG¯

 iopl=yes|no|program[,...]

 Specifies whether MS OS/2 can give data input/output privilege to a process
 that requests it in an OS/2 session. To use this command, place it in your
 CONFIG.SYS file.

 yes                               Allows MS OS/2 to give input/output
                                   privilege to a process.

 no                                Prevents MS OS/2 from giving
                                   input/output privilege to a process.
                                   This is the default setting.

 program                           Specifies the program that will be
                                   granted input/output privilege on
                                   request. You can specify more than one
                                   program, separating the names with
                                   commas.

 Some MS OS/2 applications need direct access to hardware such as the display
 adapter. The iopl command specifies whether they can receive that access.
 Examples of applications that require input/output privilege are the
 Microsoft CodeView\(rg debugger, Microsoft Word, and some printer drivers.

 You should use the iopl command only if an application requires you to do
 so.

 This command has no effect on applications that are running in the DOS
 session.


 Join

   ®DOS¯

 join [[drive1: drive2:path]|[drive1: /d]]

 Temporarily renames the disk in the first drive as a directory on the disk
 in the second drive. While a "join" is in effect, you cannot use the drive
 letter of the first drive to identify it.

 drive1:                           Specifies the drive you want to join to
                                   a directory on drive2.

 drive2:path                       Specifies the drive and path of the
                                   directory to which you want to join
                                   drive1. The directory must be a
                                   subdirectory of the root directory of
                                   drive2. If the directory already exists,
                                   it must be empty; if it does not exist,
                                   MS OS/2 creates it.

 /d                                Deletes an existing "join." You must
                                   specify drive1 to identify which "join"
                                   is to be deleted, but you must not
                                   specify drive2:path with the /d option.


 The entire directory structure of the disk in drive1 appears to be in the
 directory you have specified on the disk in drive2.

 The following utilities do not work on a drive that you have joined to a
 directory on another drive:

 .HP chkdsk 38                     "format"

 .HP diskcomp 63                   "label"

 .HP diskcopy 64                   "recover"

 .HP fdisk /d 74

 If you type join by itself, the utility displays a list of the joined
 directories currently in effect.

 The join utility affects only the DOS session. Example

 To join drive B to the directory PROJECTS on drive A, type the following:

 join b: a:\eprojects


 Keyb (Keyboard)

   ®OS2¯

 keyb [code [subcode]]

 Directs MS OS/2 to use a country-specific keyboard layout other than the
 United States layout.

 code                              Specifies the keyboard layout by country,
                                   using a two-letter code from the list
                                   that follows.

 subcode                           Specifies a keyboard layout for
                                   countries that have more than one layout,
                                   using a three-digit subcode from the
                                   list that follows.

 Subcodes are associated only with enhanced keyboards. Because France, Italy,
 and the United Kingdom have more than one enhanced-keyboard layout
 available, MS OS/2 uses the subcode to identify the specific layout to use.

 To use the keyb utility, you must have a "devinfo" command for your keyboard
 in your CONFIG.SYS file. For more information, see the "devinfo" command.

 The keyb utility affects all programs and all sessions.

 If you type keyb by itself, the utility displays the current keyboard layout
 and code-page setting. Examples

 To use a German keyboard layout, type the following:

 keyb gr

 To return to using the US keyboard layout, type the following:

 keyb us


 Keys

   ®OS2¯

 keys [on|off |list]

 Turns on or off the special functions of the DIRECTION keys and editing keys
 that enable you to edit commands on the command line. You can retrieve any
 command that is in the command-line buffer, edit it, and use it at the
 command prompt.

 on                                Turns on the special functions of the
                                   DIRECTION and editing keys used to edit
                                   commands on the command line and opens
                                   the command-line buffer so that each
                                   subsequent command is added to the
                                   buffer.

 off                               Turns off the special
                                   command-line-editing functions of the
                                   DIRECTION and editing keys and closes
                                   the command-line buffer so that
                                   subsequent commands are not added to the
                                   buffer. This is the default setting.

 list                              Lists the contents of the command-line
                                   buffer. The buffer contains a list of
                                   the last several commands you typed at
                                   the command prompt, numbered from oldest
                                   (1) to most recent.

 When you first use the keys command, MS OS/2 sets an environment variable
 (KEYS=ON or KEYS=OFF); each subsequent time you type keys on or keys off,
 the environment variable changes to reflect the new command. (No KEYS
 variable appears in the environment until the first time you use the keys
 command, unless you have previously set the variable in your CONFIG.SYS
 file.)

 The keys command affects only the current OS/2 session.

 When keys is on, the DIRECTION and editing keys have the following effects:

 ESC                               Clears the current command line and
                                   returns the cursor to the position

 END                               Places the cursor in the position
                                   immediately following the last character
                                   you typed (even if that character is a
                                   space).

 INS                               Turns insert mode on and off. The cursor
                                   appears as a half box in insert mode. As
                                   you insert characters, existing
                                   characters to the right of the cursor
                                   move to the right. At the beginning of
                                   each new command line, insert mode is
                                   turned off.

 DEL                               Deletes the character marked by the
                                   cursor. As you delete characters,
                                   existing characters to the right of the
                                   cursor move to the left.

 LEFT                              Moves the cursor left one character.

 RIGHT                             Moves the cursor right one character.

 UP                                Moves to the previous command listed in
                                   memory and brings that command to the
                                   command line.

 DOWN                              Moves to the next command listed in
                                   memory and brings that command to the
                                   command line.

 BACKSPACE                         Moves the cursor back (left) one
                                   character and deletes that character.
                                   Existing characters to the right of the
                                   cursor move to the left.

 CTRL+LEFT                         Moves the cursor left to the first
                                   character of the previous word.

 CTRL+RIGHT                        Moves the cursor right to the first
                                   character of the next word.

 CTRL+END                          Deletes all characters from the current
                                   cursor position to the end of the
                                   command line.

 CTRL+HOME                         Deletes all characters from the
                                   beginning of the command line up to (but
                                   not including) the current cursor
                                   position.

 ENTER                             Sends the information on the command
                                   line to the command interpreter, adds it
                                   to the list of commands in memory, and
                                   turns off insert mode.

 Keys on remains in effect until you type keys off. MS OS/2 adds commands to
 the command-line buffer only while the keys command is active, but it
 retains the buffer in memory until you end the session. Typing keys off does
 not empty the buffer; if you type keys on again in the same session, MS OS/2
 adds any subsequent commands to the existing commands in the buffer.

 The command-line buffer cannot be larger than 64K, but it might be smaller
 if there is not enough memory to extend the list. When the buffer is full,
 MS OS/2 discards the oldest command to make room for the newest.

 Only commands you type at the keyboard are added to the command-line buffer.
 Commands in a batch file or commands that are part of redirected input are
 not added.

 If you type keys by itself, MS OS/2 displays the current setting.


 Label

   ®OS2¯

 label [drive:][label]

 Assigns a disk a new volume label.

 drive:                            Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   disk to which you want to give a new
                                   volume label.

 label                             Specifies the new volume label for the
                                   disk in the specified drive. The label
                                   can be up to 11 characters, including
                                   spaces. Do not use any of the following
                                   characters in a volume label: * ? / \e |
                                   . , ; : + = < > [ ] & ^ " If you do not
                                   specify a drive, MS OS/2 assigns label
                                   to the disk in the current drive.

 Programs use the volume label, which is simply a name for the disk, to
 identify the disk. The "dir" command displays the volume label in addition
 to information about a disk's contents.

 If you type label by itself, the utility displays the volume label of the
 disk in the current drive and prompts you to either type a new label or
 press ENTER to retain the current label.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Do not use the label utility on drives that you have assigned, joined, or
 substituted by using the "assign" , "join" , or "subst" utility. Example

 To give the volume label OLD STUFF to the disk in drive A, type the
 following:

 label a:old stuff


 Libpath (Library Path)

   ®CONFIG¯

 libpath=[drive:]path[;[drive:]path][...]

 Specifies the directories MS OS/2 is to search for dynamic-link libraries.
 To use this command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 drive:                            Specifies the drive where dynamic-link
                                   libraries are located. If you do not
                                   specify a drive, MS OS/2 searches the
                                   disk in the current drive.

 path                              Specifies the directory to search for
                                   dynamic-link libraries. You can specify
                                   more than one directory, separating the
                                   names with semicolons (;).

 The MS OS/2 installation program places the following line in your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 libpath=c:\eos2\edll;c:\e

 MS OS/2 does not automatically search the current directory for dynamic-link
 libraries; you can specify the current directory by substituting a period
 (.) for the first drive:path argument. Example

 To instruct MS OS/2 to look for dynamic-link libraries in the current
 directory and in the directory DYNLIB on your hard disk (drive C), include
 the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 libpath=.;c:\edynlib


 Log

   ®CONFIG¯

 log=on | off [/m:minfree] [/w:filesize] [/b:buffersize] [/f:filename]

 Turns system-event logging on or off. When logging is on, MS OS/2 records
 system events in the system log file. To use this command, place it in your
 CONFIG.SYS file.

 on                                Starts system-event logging.

 off                               Stops system-event logging. This is the
                                   default setting.

 /m:minfree                        Specifies the minimum amount of disk
                                   space, in kilobytes, to be left free
                                   (that is, not used for system-event
                                   logging) on your hard disk. The default
                                   value is 512.

 /w:filesize                       Instructs MS OS/2 to wrap entries to the
                                   log file, if necessary, in order to
                                   limit the size of the file to filesize
                                   kilobytes. If you specify /w and the log
                                   file is full, MS OS/2 adds new entries
                                   to the beginning of the file,
                                   overwriting the existing entries. If you
                                   do not specify /w, MS OS/2 adds all new
                                   entries to the end of the log file,
                                   increasing the size of the file as
                                   necessary. The default size of the log
                                   file is 64K.

 /b:buffersize                     Specifies the size, in kilobytes, of the
                                   buffer to be used for logging system
                                   events. The maximum size is 64K; the
                                   default value is 4.

 /f:filename                       Specifies the name of the log file. The
                                   filename must not include an extension;
                                   the logging facility automatically
                                   supplies the extension .DAT. The
                                   log-file name should have the form LOG
                                   xxxx.DAT, where xxxx stands for a
                                   four-digit number; the default filename
                                   is LOG0001.DAT.



 Maxwait (Maximum Wait)

   ®CONFIG¯

 maxwait=x

 Sets the maximum time a process must wait before MS OS/2 increases its
 priority. To use this command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 x                                 Specifies the number of seconds a
                                   process must wait before it is given a
                                   higher priority. This number must be in
                                   the range 1 through 255; the default
                                   value is 3.

 When an active process has waited x seconds without running, the MS OS/2
 scheduler increases the priority of the process for one execution cycle
 (time slice). For more information about time slices, see the "timeslice"
 command.

 The maxwait command has no effect if the "priority" command is set to
 absolute. Example

 To instruct MS OS/2 to give priority to processes after they have waited 2
 seconds, include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 maxwait=2


 Memman (Memory Management)

   ®CONFIG¯

 memman=[swap|noswap][,][move|nomove][,][swapdos|noswapdos]

 Specifies whether MS OS/2 can swap memory segments between memory and disk
 and whether it can temporarily move segments. To use this command, place it
 in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 swap                              Allows swapping of segments.

 noswap                            Prevents swapping of segments.

 move                              Allows moving of segments.

 nomove                            Prevents moving of segments.

 swapdos                           Allows swapping of memory segments from
                                   the DOS session. If you specify swapdos,
                                   MS OS/2 automatically sets the swap and
                                   move options.

 noswapdos                         Prevents swapping of memory segments
                                   from the DOS session.

 You can use a space instead of a comma to separate the arguments of a memman
 command.

 The MS OS/2 installation program places a memman command in your CONFIG.SYS
 file. If you start MS OS/2 from a hard disk, the default setting is
 memman=swap,move,noswapdos; if you start from a floppy disk, the default
 setting is memman=noswap,move,noswapdos. If you have disabled the DOS
 session by specifying protectonly=yes in your CONFIG.SYS file, the
 installation program does not place the noswapdos argument in your
 CONFIG.SYS file.

 If you allow MS OS/2 to swap, then it can move segments too, but the reverse
 is not automatically true.

 MS OS/2 may not swap the DOS session if you use the mode utility to
 configure a serial port or if you switch to another session while a DOS
 program is reading from or writing to a file.

 For more information about swapping and moving memory segments, see the
 Microsoft Operating System/2 User's Guide. Example

 To prevent MS OS/2 from swapping or moving data segments while you are
 running a time-dependent application, include the following line in your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 memman=noswap,nomove

 To allow swapping of memory segments from the DOS session and swapping and
 moving of other memory segments, include the following line in your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 memman=swapdos


 Mkdir (Make Directory)

   ®OS2¯

 mkdir [drive:][path]directoryname [[drive:][path]directoryname [...]]

 Creates a directory. You can abbreviate mkdir as md.

 directoryname                     Specifies the name of the new directory.
                                   Unless you specify a different drive
                                   and/or path, MS OS/2 creates the new
                                   directory as a subdirectory of the
                                   current directory.

 You can create more than one directory at a time by specifying multiple
 directory names. MS OS/2 creates each directory for which you do not
 specifically indicate a drive and path as a subdirectory of the current
 directory.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that in the DOS session you cannot specify multiple directory names.

 Example

 To create the directory CLIENT, and the subdirectory PETE under it, on drive
 A, type the following:

 mkdir a:\eclient a:\eclient\epete


 Mode

 Sets operating parameters for communication and output devices that you may
 connect to or add to your computer. These devices include parallel and
 serial printers, modems, and screens. The mode utility enables you to change
 settings by using a command line instead of physically setting switches in
 your computer.

 The mode utility has several discrete purposes. The following sections
 explain the different ways in which you can use the utility.


 Mode: Configuring a Parallel Printer

   ®OS2¯

 mode LPTn[:] [chars][,[lines][,p]]

 Controls the line and character spacing of the output on a parallel printer.


 n                                 Specifies the number of the parallel
                                   port the printer is connected to (1, 2,
                                   etc.). (You can use PRN in place of
                                   LPT1; they are equivalent.) The colon is
                                   optional. This information is required.

 chars                             Specifies the number of characters per
                                   line. This number can be either 80 or
                                   132; the default value is 80. If you
                                   enter nothing for this parameter, the
                                   mode utility does not change the current
                                   number of characters per line.

 lines                             Specifies vertical spacing, the number
                                   of lines per inch. This number can be
                                   either 6 or 8; the default value is 6.
                                   If you enter nothing for this parameter,
                                   the mode utility does not change the
                                   current vertical spacing. You must type
                                   the comma before lines, even if you did
                                   not specify a new value for chars. If
                                   you do not specify a value for chars, do
                                   not include a space after LPTn[:].

 p                                 Turns on "infinite retry," which causes
                                   MS OS/2 to keep trying to send output to
                                   the printer if a time-out error occurs.
                                   With this option, part of the mode
                                   utility remains resident in memory. You
                                   must type both commas before p, even if
                                   you did not specify new values for chars
                                   and lines. If you do not specify this
                                   option, infinite retry is turned off. If
                                   you do not specify a value for chars, do
                                   not include a space after LPTn[:].

 If your system gets stuck in a time-out loop, where it keeps trying to send
 output to the printer but cannot succeed, you can exit from the loop by
 pressing CTRL+C.

 The mode utility will affect your printer only if the spooler has been
 turned off in Print Manager.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To configure the printer connected to your computer's second
 parallel-printer port (LPT2) to print at 80 characters per line and 8 lines
 per inch, type the following:

 mode lpt2 80,8


 Mode: Configuring a Serial Port

   ®OS2¯

 mode COMm[:] [baud[,parity][,databits][,stopbits]]
 [,to=state][,xon=state][,idsr=state][,odsr=state] [,octs=state][,dtr=state]
 [,rts=state][,buffer=state]

 Sets the parameters for communication with a serial printer or other device
 that uses a serial port. This is the port you use for asynchronous
 communication.

 m                                 Specifies the number of the serial port
                                   you want to use (1, 2, etc.). The colon
                                   is optional. This information is
                                   required.

 If you omit any of the following four arguments, the mode utility uses the
 most recent settings. (The first time you use the utility, mode uses the
 default settings; thereafter, it uses the most recent settings.) The mode
 utility recognizes these arguments by their positions, so if you leave out
 an argument, you must still type the comma that precedes the next one.

 baud                              Specifies the first two digits of the
                                   transmission rate in bits per second:
                                   110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400,
                                   3600, 4800, 7200, 9600, or 19200. This
                                   argument is required, unless you are
                                   merely checking the current settings.

 parity                            Specifies how the system uses the parity
                                   bit to check for errors in transmission.
                                   The possible values are N (no parity), O
                                   (odd parity), E (even parity), M (mark;
                                   parity bit always 1), and S ; parity bit
                                   always zero); the default value is E.

 databits                          Specifies the number of data bits in a
                                   character. This number can be 5, 6, 7,
                                   or 8; the default value is 7.

 stopbits                          Specifies the number of stop bits that
                                   define the end of a character. This
                                   number can be 1, 1.5, or 2. If the baud
                                   rate is 110, the default value for
                                   stopbits is 2; otherwise, the default
                                   value is 1. If you specify 1.5 for
                                   stopbits, you must specify 5 for
                                   databits.

 You can list the following options in any order after the stopbits argument,
 separating them with commas. The default settings listed for these options
 apply only when you first start your computer; thereafter, the default
 setting for an option is its previous setting.

 to=on|off                         Specifies whether infinite time-out
                                   processing is enabled (on) or disabled (
                                   off). The default setting is off.

 xon=on|off                        Specifies whether the XON/XOFF protocol
                                   for data-flow control is enabled (on) or
                                   disabled (off). The default setting is
                                   off.

 idsr=on|off                       Specifies whether input handshaking that
                                   uses the DSR (Data Set Ready) circuit is
                                   enabled (on) or disabled (off). The
                                   default setting is on.

 odsr=on|off                       Specifies whether output handshaking
                                   that uses the DSR (Data Set Ready)
                                   circuit is enabled (on) or disabled (off
                                   ). The default setting is on.

 octs=on|off                       Specifies whether output handshaking
                                   that uses the CTS (Clear to Send)
                                   circuit is enabled (on) or disabled (off
                                   ). The default setting is on.

 dtr=on|off|hs                     Specifies whether the DTR (Data Terminal
                                   Ready) circuit is enabled (on) or
                                   disabled (off), or whether DTR
                                   handshaking is enabled (hs). The default
                                   setting is on.

 rts=on|off|hs|tog                 Specifies whether the RTS (Request to
                                   Send) circuit is enabled (on) or
                                   disabled (off), whether RTS handshaking
                                   is enabled (hs), or whether RTS toggling
                                   is enabled (tog). The default setting is
                                   on.

 The following option applies only to communications hardware or drivers
 capable of extended hardware buffering.

 buffer=on|off|auto                Specifies whether extended hardware
                                   buffering is enabled (on), disabled (off
                                   ), or controlled automatically by the
                                   device driver (auto). The default
                                   setting is auto for device drivers that
                                   support extended hardware buffering; the
                                   default setting is off for device
                                   drivers that do not. (If a serial port
                                   does not support extended hardware
                                   buffering, the mode utility does not
                                   display or change the setting for this
                                   option.) On a system where both the
                                   hardware and the device drivers do
                                   support extended hardware buffering,
                                   buffer=off can seriously slow down
                                   system performance; buffer=on gives you
                                   the best possible performance on such a
                                   system, but this setting may not be
                                   compatible with some devices that have
                                   particularly strict requirements for the
                                   timing of events. Unless you are certain
                                   that your hardware supports extended
                                   hardware buffering and that you are
                                   using device drivers that also support
                                   it, do not change this option.

 If you type mode COMm by itself, the utility displays the current settings
 for the specified serial port.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that you cannot use mode COMm by itself; you cannot use the to=state,
 xon=state, idsr=state, odsr=state, octs=state, dtr=state, rts=state, or
 buffer=state options; and there is an additional option, p.

 p                                 Specifies a time-out value of about
                                   thirty seconds for DOS programs that
                                   directly control the hardware. You must
                                   use the "setcom40"utility to tell the
                                   program the address of the serial port
                                   before you use the port. The p option
                                   must always be last on the command line.

 Some programs require the additional information that you can specify with
 the MS OS/2 version of the mode utility. If you are going to use one of
 those programs, you must configure your serial port from the OS/2 command
 prompt. Example

 To set the baud rate to 300, set the parity to odd, leave the number of data
 bits set to 7, and set the number of stop bits to 2, for your computer's
 first serial port, type the following:

 mode com1: 300,o,,2


 Mode: Setting Up the Screen

   ®OS2¯

 mode display[,rows]

 Sets the way text is displayed on your screen, including the number of
 characters per line, the number of lines per screen, and whether the text is
 in color.

 display                           Specifies the kind of display adapter
                                   you are using: 40, 80, BW40, BW80, CO40,
                                   CO80, or MONO. For each of these options,
                                   40 and 80 indicate the number of
                                   characters per line. BW means that color
                                   has been disabled even though you have a
                                   color graphics adapter; CO means that
                                   color has been enabled. MONO specifies a
                                   monochrome display adapter, which always
                                   has 80 characters per line.

 rows                              Specifies the number of rows (lines) on
                                   the screen: 25, 43, 50, or 60. Which of
                                   these are valid depends on the kind of
                                   display adapter you have. The default
                                   setting when you first start your
                                   computer is 25; thereafter, the previous
                                   setting is the default setting.

 When you use the mode utility to change the way text is displayed on the
 screen, it affects only the current session.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To set a screen adapter so that it uses color, 80 characters per line, and
 43 lines per screen (assuming the display adapter can handle such settings),
 type the following:

 mode co80,43


 Mode: Setting Floppy-Disk Verify Capability

   ®OS2¯

 mode dskt [ver=on|off]

 Specifies whether MS OS/2 should verify that data is correctly written to a
 floppy disk. The default setting is ver=off.

 If you type mode dskt by itself, the utility displays the current setting.

 This command affects all sessions.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session it does in an OS/2 session.


 More

   ®OS2¯

 more < source

 Reads from standard input and displays what it reads, one screenful at a
 time.

 source                            Specifies the source of the input. You
                                   can redirect input from a file or from
                                   an MS OS/2 command or utility. For more
                                   information about redirection, see the
                                   Microsoft Operating System/2 User's
                                   Guide.

 You can use more to view the contents of a long file or the results of a
 command screenful by screenful. After each screenful, more displays the
 following at the bottom of your screen:

 --More-

 You can press any key to display the next screenful.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Examples

 To view the contents of the file IDEAS.OLD one screenful at a time, type the
 following:

 more < ideas.old

 To sort the file IDEAS.OLD alphabetically and view the output one screenful
 at a time, type the following:

 sort < ideas.old | more

 If you use this example in the DOS session, the pipe creates temporary files
 in which to store information. For this reason, you cannot use the DOS pipe
 feature if the current disk or directory is full or the disk is
 write-protected.


 MOUSE.SYS

   ®CONFIG¯

 device=[drive:][path]mouse.sys type=typename [mode=mode] [qsize=size]

 Directs MS OS/2 to load the MOUSE.SYS device driver. To use this command,
 place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 The MOUSE.SYS device driver is a device-independent mouse driver common to
 all mice used with any computer running MS OS/2. You must have this driver
 installed on your system in order to use a pointing device with MS OS/2. You
 must also have a device-dependent mouse driver (MSxxxx0x.SYS) and the
 pointer driver ( "POINTDD.SYS" ) installed.

 type=typename                     Identifies the kind of mouse you are
                                   using. This value must be a string of
                                   characters that ends with a dollar sign
                                   ($). For the correct name for your mouse,
                                   see your mouse manual.

 mode=mode                         Specifies whether you'll be using the
                                   mouse in an OS/2 session, the DOS
                                   session, or both. Acceptable values for
                                   mode are p (protected mode, OS/2
                                   session), r (real mode, DOS session),
                                   and b (both); the default value is b.

 qsize=size                        Specifies the size, in bytes, of the
                                   queue buffer to be allocated for each MS
                                   OS/2 session. This number must be in the
                                   range 1 through 100; the default value
                                   is 10.

 Example

 To direct MS OS/2 to load the pointer and mouse device drivers so that you
 can use the InPort model of the Microsoft Mouse on an IBM PC/AT or
 compatible computer, add the following lines to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\pointdd.sys
 device=c:\os2\msinp01.sys
 device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msinp$

 You must specify the mouse-dependent device driver ( "MSxxxx0x.SYS" ) before
 the mouse-independent device driver (MOUSE.SYS). If you are using a serial
 mouse, the "device" =mouse-drivers commands must precede any
 device=com0x.sys commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.


 Move

   ®OS2¯

 move [drive:][path1]source [path2][destination]

 Moves a file or directory from one directory to another on the same drive.

 source                            Specifies the file or directory to be
                                   moved. You can use wildcard characters
                                   to specify a group of files, but you can
                                   move only one directory at a time. If
                                   you do not specify a drive or directory
                                   for source, MS OS/2 searches for it in
                                   the current directory on the current
                                   drive.

 destination                       Specifies where the file or directory is
                                   to be moved. If you are moving a file,
                                   the destination can be either a file or
                                   a directory. The destination must always
                                   be on the same drive as the source.

 You can change the name of a file or directory as you move it, by specifying
 a new name in destination. If you are moving multiple files and you want to
 change their names, you must specify multiple destination-file names by
 using the same wildcard characters you used in the source-file names.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 In the high-performance file system (HPFS), you can use the move command to
 change the case of a filename or directory name by moving the file or
 directory to itself. For example, you can change the filename
 "mytaxfile.txt" to "MYTAXFILE.TXT" by using the uppercase version of the
 name as the destination argument. (The quotation marks around the filenames
 are required when you are using HPFS. For more information about HPFS, see
 the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's Guide.)
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 When you use the move command to relocate a file or directory, MS OS/2 will
 not write over an existing file or directory that has the same name. If you
 specify an existing filename as the destination, MS OS/2 displays an error
 message and does not carry out the command. If you specify an existing
 directory name as the destination, MS OS/2 moves the source file or
 directory into that directory; if the source was a directory, it becomes a
 subdirectory of the destination directory.

 Moving a file or directory does not change its date or time. Examples

 To move all the files with the extension .DOC from the current directory to
 the directory \REPORTS\OLD on the current drive and change their extensions
 to .OLD, type the following:

 move *.doc \reports\old\*.old

 To move the directory LETTERS from the current directory and make it a
 subdirectory of the directory \BUSINESS\SEPT89 on the current drive, type
 the following:

 move letters \business\sept89


 MSxxxx0x.SYS

   ®CONFIG¯

 device=[drive:][path]msxxxx0x.sys [serial=device] [model=style]

 Directs MS OS/2 to load a device-dependent mouse driver. To use this
 command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 The MSxxxx0x.SYS device driver is a device-dependent mouse driver specific
 to the mouse you are using and the system on which you are running MS OS/2.
 You must have a device-dependent mouse driver installed on your system in
 order to use a pointing device with MS OS/2. You must also have the
 device-independent mouse driver ( "MOUSE.SYS" ) and the pointer driver (
 "POINTDD.SYS" ) installed.

 serial=device                     Specifies the communications port to
                                   which the mouse is connected. Acceptable
                                   values are COM1 and COM2 for IBM PC/AT
                                   and compatible computers, and COM1
                                   through COM8 for IBM PS/2 and compatible
                                   computers. The default value is COM1 for
                                   a serial mouse. This option is not used
                                   with a parallel mouse.

 model=style                       Specifies the model of Microsoft Mouse
                                   you are using. Acceptable values are 099
                                   (mouse with green buttons) and 199
                                   (mouse with gray buttons or serial mouse
                                   with white buttons). If you have a
                                   serial mouse, you must specify the model.

 A device-dependent mouse driver can have any name of the form xxxxxx0x.SYS;
 MSxxxx0x.SYS is the form for Microsoft mice.

 To set up a mouse device driver, you must choose the driver that matches
 your mouse hardware and your computer. For information on the mouse driver
 for your mouse, see your mouse manual. The following list shows examples of
 mouse drivers that are available with MS OS/2:

                                               and compatible computers

 Example

 To direct MS OS/2 to load the pointer and mouse device drivers so that you
 can use the InPort model of the Microsoft Mouse on an IBM PC/AT or
 compatible computer, add the following lines to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\pointdd.sys
 device=c:\os2\msinp01.sys
 device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msinp$

 You must specify the mouse-dependent device driver (MSxxxx0x.SYS) before the
 mouse-independent device driver ( "MOUSE.SYS" ). If you are using a serial
 mouse, the "device" =mouse-drivers commands must precede any
 device=com0x.sys commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.


 Patch

   ®OS2¯

 patch [drive:][path]filename [/a]

 Inserts a section of program code into an existing MS OS/2 program or
 application to change the way the program runs. Any file that can be written
 to can be patched.

 filename                          Specifies the file to patch.

 /a                                Specifies the automatic operation mode.
                                   With the /a option, filename must be a
                                   file containing instructions for
                                   patching one or more files automatically.

 The patch utility has two modes of operation: automatic and interactive.
 Interactive mode is the default mode. In this mode, you supply the path of
 the file you want to patch on the patch command line. Patch then prompts you
 for the offset at which a patch is to be made and for the patch contents.
 (Patch can change bytes at any position in a file or add bytes to the end of
 a file.) You must type both the offset and the patch contents in hexadecimal
 notation.

 After you supply the hexadecimal offset, the patch utility displays the 16
 bytes at that offset. You can then change any or all of the 16 bytes. If you
 decide not to make any changes, you can press the ESC key.

 The cursor is initially positioned on the first byte. To change this byte,
 type one or two hexadecimal digits. To leave the byte unchanged and move to
 the next byte, press the SPACEBAR. Press BACKSPACE to move the cursor back
 if you make a mistake. If you move the cursor past the last byte displayed,
 the patch utility displays the next 16 bytes. This cycle continues until you
 press ENTER.

 When you press ENTER, the patch utility saves the patch information and asks
 if you want to make any more patches. If you respond with "Y", patch again
 prompts you for an offset. After you have entered all the patches you want
 to make and responded with "N" at the "more patches" prompt, patch displays
 the patches on the screen and asks if they should be applied. If you respond
 with "Y", patch writes all the saved patch requests to disk in the same
 order in which you entered them.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Warning

 You should use the patch utility only if you understand the need for a
 patch, how to make the patch, and the effect the patch will have on program
 operation. Before you use the patch utility, be sure to make backup copies
 of the files to which the patches will be applied.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


 Path

   ®OS2¯

 path [;|[drive:]path[;...]]

 Specifies where MS OS/2 is to search for a command file or application if
 the program is not in the current directory.

 ;                                 When used alone (path ;), clears all
                                   search-path settings. Semicolons are
                                   also used to separate multiple paths.

 path                              Specifies the path of the directory that
                                   MS OS/2 is to search for command files.
                                   If you do not specify a drive, MS OS/2
                                   uses the current drive.

 If any name in one of the paths you set contains a semicolon (;), you must
 enclose each path you specify in double quotation marks (").

 If you type path by itself, MS OS/2 displays the current search path.

 The path command affects only the current session. To specify a path for all
 OS/2 sessions, you must set the PATH environment variable in your CONFIG.SYS
 file. For information about how to do this, see the "set" command. For the
 DOS session, set the PATH environment variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To instruct MS OS/2 to search for a command file in the directories BIN and
 WORD on drive C and the subdirectory WORD of the APPS directory on drive A,
 type the following:

 path c:\ebin;c:\eword;a:\eapps\eword


 Pause

   ®OS2¯

 pause [comment]

 Suspends processing of a batch file and displays a message that asks the
 user to press any key to continue. Use this command only in a batch file.

 comment                           Specifies the message you want to have
                                   appear before the line "Press any key
                                   when ready...". The message can be any
                                   combination of characters. The echo
                                   feature must be on for comment to appear
                                   on the screen.

 You can use this command to make a batch program pause any time the user has
 to do something, such as read a message or insert a disk, before continuing
 with the program.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in a DOS batch file (.BAT extension) as it does in an
 OS/2 batch file (

 Example

 To have your batch program pause and prompt the user to insert a new disk in
 drive A before continuing, type the following at the appropriate point in
 the batch file:

 pause Please put a new disk into drive A.


 Pauseonerror

   ®CONFIG¯

 pauseonerror=yes|no

 Specifies whether MS OS/2 is to pause if it encounters an error while
 processing your CONFIG.SYS file during system start-up. To use this command,
 place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 If pauseonerror is set to yes (the default setting), then whenever MS OS/2
 encounters an error while processing your CONFIG.SYS file, it stops,
 displays an error message, and prompts you to press ENTER to continue the
 start-up process. If you have set pauseonerror to no, MS OS/2 displays an
 error message when it encounters an error, but it does not stop. Example

 To instruct MS OS/2 to process your CONFIG.SYS file without pausing when it
 encounters errors, include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 pauseonerror=no


 POINTDD.SYS

   ®CONFIG¯

 device=[drive:][path]pointdd.sys

 Directs MS OS/2 to load the POINTDD.SYS device driver. To use this command,
 place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 To use a mouse with MS OS/2, you must set up the POINTDD.SYS driver as well
 as the mouse drivers. The POINTDD.SYS driver provides information that MS
 OS/2 needs in order to draw the mouse pointer. Example

 To use the InPort model of the Microsoft Mouse on an IBM PC/AT or compatible
 computer, you must include the following lines in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os2\pointdd.sys
 device=c:\os2\msinp01.sys
 device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msinp$


 Print

   ®OS2¯

 print [/d:device] [/b] [drive:][path]filename [...]

 or

 print [/d:device] [/t\^|/c]

 Sends a file to a device to be printed.

 /d:device                         Specifies the printer to use. The
                                   default device is LPT1.

 /b                                Instructs MS OS/2 not to interpret
                                   CTRL+Z characters in the file as
                                   end-of-file characters.

 filename                          Specifies the file to print. If you
                                   specify more than one file, the files
                                   are printed in the order you type them
                                   on the command line.

 /t                                Stops all printing and removes all files
                                   from the print queue, if the spooler is
                                   active for the specified device.

 /c                                Stops printing the file being printed
                                   and removes it from the print queue, if
                                   the spooler is active for the specified
                                   device.


   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that you cannot use the /t and /c options.

 Example

 To print the file PENCIL.TST, which is in the current directory on the
 current drive, on the printer connected to your computer's third parallel
 port (LPT3), type the following:

 print /d:lpt3 pencil.tst


 Priority

   ®CONFIG¯

 priority=absolute|dynamic

 Specifies how a process receives enough priority over other processes to
 run. To use this command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 In MS OS/2, processes (threads) are divided into three categories according
 to their priority: general, time-critical, and low. The general-priority
 category is further divided into foreground, background, and interactive
 subcategories. Normally, MS OS/2 automatically adjusts the priority levels
 of general-priority processes as circumstances change (for example, when a
 foreground process becomes a background process).

 absolute                          .LI Prevents the system from dynamically
                                   changing the priority of processes in
                                   the general-priority category. The
                                   absolute setting allocates
                                   central-processing-unit (CPU) time
                                   according to the process's current
                                   priority.

 dynamic                           .LI Instructs MS OS/2 to try to
                                   determine which process needs CPU
                                   resources most in any given interval of
                                   time (time slice). The dynamic setting
                                   gives more CPU time to the process that
                                   is running in the foreground. This is
                                   the default setting. For more
                                   information about time slices, see the
                                   "timeslice"command.


 You should use the priority command only if an application requires you to
 do so.


 Prompt

   ®OS2¯

 prompt [string]

 Changes the prompt for the current MS OS/2 command interpreter. This change
 affects only the current session.

 string                            .LI Specifies the new prompt. You can
                                   specify any character string you want,
                                   or you can use any of the $x character
                                   combinations from the list that follows
                                   to customize your prompt. (You can
                                   combine text and these character
                                   combinations in any order.) Any spaces
                                   that you type appear as part of the
                                   prompt.

 The following character combinations are available for use in customizing
 your prompt:

 Combination                       Action
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 $$                                Displays the dollar-sign character ($).

 $_                                Begins a new line on the screen.

 $a                                Displays an ampersand (&).

 $b                                Displays the pipe symbol (|).

 $c                                Displays a left parenthesis [(].

 $d                                Displays the current date.

 $e                                Specifies the beginning of an ANSI
                                   escape code.

 $f                                Displays a right parenthesis [)].

 $g                                Displays the greater-than sign (>).

 $h                                Represents the backspace character; this
                                   erases the previous character from the
                                   prompt.

 $i                                Displays the Help line.

 $l                                Displays the less-than sign (<).

 $n                                Displays the current drive letter.

 $p                                Displays the current drive letter and
                                   path.

 $q                                Displays the equal sign (=).

 $t                                Displays the current time.

 $v                                Displays the MS OS/2 version number.


 If you type prompt by itself, MS OS/2 resets the prompt to the system
 default prompt. In an OS/2 session, the system default prompt is the current
 drive letter and the name of the current directory, in brackets.

 The prompt command affects only the current session. To specify a prompt for
 all OS/2 sessions, you must set the PROMPT environment variable in your
 CONFIG.SYS file. For more information about how to do this, see the "set"
 command. For the DOS session, set the PROMPT environment variable in your
 AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that you cannot use $a, $c, and $f and the system default prompt is the
 current drive letter, followed by a greater-than sign (>).

 Example

 To change your prompt so that it displays the time on one line and the
 current drive and directory on the next, followed by a space and a
 greater-than sign, type the following:

 prompt The time is $t$h$h$h$h$h$h$_$p $g

 The new prompt has the following form:

 The time is 13:37
 C:\OS2 >

 Notice that the $h characters erased the seconds and hundredths of seconds
 from the time display.


 Protectonly

   ®CONFIG¯

 protectonly=yes|no

 Specifies whether MS OS/2 is to enable the DOS session. To use this command,
 place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 The MS OS/2 installation program places the protectonly=no command in your
 CONFIG.SYS file so that you can run the DOS session. To set up your system
 to run the Presentation Manager and OS/2 sessions only, change this line to
 protectonly=yes.


 Protshell (Protected Shell)

   ®CONFIG¯

 protshell=[drive:][path]filename [arguments]

 Specifies the user interface MS OS/2 is to use and the command interpreter
 to use in an OS/2 session. To use this command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS
 file.

 filename                          Specifies the file that contains the
                                   user interface. If this file is not in
                                   the root directory of the start-up drive,
                                   you must include the drive and/or path.

 arguments                         Specifies the drive, path, and filename
                                   of the MS OS/2 initialization file and
                                   command interpreter. For more
                                   information about these arguments, see
                                   the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's
                                   Guide.

 The MS OS/2 installation program places the following line in your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 protshell=c:\eos2\epmshell.exe c:\eos2\eos2.ini c:\eos2\ecmd.exe

 This command instructs MS OS/2 to use the Presentation Manager user
 interface and to use the "cmd" command interpreter in OS/2 sessions.

 The protshell command has no effect on the DOS session.


 Pstat (Process Status)

   ®OS2¯

 pstat [/c|/s|/l|/m|/p:pid]

 Displays information about the status of one or more processes in the
 system.

 /c                                Displays information about each of the
                                   current processes and threads.

 /s                                Displays system-semaphore information
                                   for each thread in the system.

 /l                                Displays the names of the run-time
                                   linked libraries for each process in the
                                   system.

 /m                                Displays the named-shared memory
                                   information for each process in the
                                   system.

 /p:pid                            Displays information about a particular
                                   process, identified by its process
                                   identification number (pid).

 If you type pstat by itself, the utility displays all the information for
 all the options.


 Recover

   ®OS2¯

 recover [drive:]|[drive:][path] filename

 Reconstructs all the files from a disk that has a damaged directory
 structure or reconstructs a single file from a disk that has bad sectors.

 drive:                            .LI Specifies the drive containing the
                                   disk with the files you want to try to
                                   reconstruct. If you specify only a drive,
                                   the recover utility tries to reconstruct
                                   the entire contents of the disk in that
                                   drive, giving the reconstructed files
                                   names of the form FILEnnnn.REC, where
                                   nnnn is a four-digit number. In this
                                   case, the files being reconstructed lose
                                   their extended attributes. The recover
                                   utility reconstructs the extended
                                   attributes, if possible, and stores them
                                   in a separate FILEnnnn.REC file.

 filename                          .LI Specifies the file you want to try
                                   to reconstruct. If you do not specify a
                                   drive or path, the recover utility uses
                                   the current directory on the current
                                   drive. You cannot use wildcard
                                   characters in filename. If the file has
                                   extended attributes, recover tries to
                                   reconstruct all of them along with the
                                   file, but if it cannot do so, it puts
                                   whatever extended attributes it can
                                   reconstruct into a file named EA0001.REC.

 MS OS/2 recovers a file by reading it, sector by sector, skipping the bad
 sectors.

 All files created by the recover utility are stored in the root directory of
 the specified drive.

 When you use the recover utility on a disk or partition that is formatted
 for HPFS, you can reconstruct only one file at a time. The utility
 reconstructs the file with its original filename and location, if possible.

 If you type recover by itself (in the FAT file system), the utility tries to
 reconstruct all the files in the current directory on the current drive.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Warning

 Before you use this utility, make a backup copy of your disk and try to
 restore the files by using the "restore" utility. If this operation fails,
 use the recover utility to try to reconstruct the lost files one by one. Do
 not use recover to reconstruct an entire disk unless the entire disk is
 unreadable.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 You cannot use the recover utility on the drive from which you started your
 system, nor on the drive from which you are running recover. To reconstruct
 files on your start-up drive, you must run recover from the MS OS/2 Install
 disk. You can do the same thing to reconstruct files on the drive from which
 you would normally run recover, or you can simply copy the utility to
 another drive and run it from there.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that you cannot use the recover utility on an HPFS disk or partition from
 the DOS session.

 You cannot use the recover utility with drives that you have assigned,
 joined, or substituted by using the "assign" , "join" , or "subst" utility.
 Example

 To try to reconstruct the file REPORT.TXT from the disk with bad sectors in
 drive B, type the following:

 recover b:\ereport.txt

 To try to reconstruct the file JANUARYstart-up drive, insert the MS OS/2
 Install disk in drive A, press CTL+ALT+DEL, press ESC when the logo appears,
 and then type the following at the command prompt:

 recover c:\january


 Rem (Remark)

   ®OS2¯

 rem [comment]

 Includes a descriptive comment in a batch file. If the echo feature is on
 when MS OS/2 encounters a rem line in a batch file, MS OS/2 displays the
 line; if the echo feature is off, MS OS/2 does not display the line. To use
 this version of the rem command, place it in the batch file.

 comment                           Specifies the message you want to put in
                                   the batch file. Comment can be any
                                   combination of characters that fits on
                                   one line.


 If the comment you want to put in the batch file is too long to fit on one
 line, you must use the rem command again for each line in the comment. You
 can also use rem without comment to add spacing between blocks of comments
 or remarks.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in a DOS batch file (.BAT extension) as it does in an
 OS/2 batch file (

 Example

 The following batch file uses the rem command both to include comments in
 the file and to add spacing:

 @echo off
 rem This batch file displays the directory
 rem of the disk in drive A.
 rem
 rem You use the /w option to display
 rem the directory in wide format.
 rem
 dir a: /w


 Rem (Remark)

   ®CONFIG¯

 rem [text]

 Includes a remark or descriptive comment in your CONFIG.SYS file. Lines that
 begin with rem are not processed by MS OS/2.

 text                              Specifies the remark or comment that you
                                   want to include in your CONFIG.SYS file.
                                   Text may be any string of characters
                                   that fits on one line.

 If the comment you want to put in the CONFIG.SYS file is too long to fit on
 one line, you must use the rem command again for each line of the comment.
 You can also use rem without text to add spacing between blocks of comments
 or remarks. Example

 To leave a comment in a configuration file for another person's use or to
 remind yourself of the purposes of the commands in the file, begin each line
 of the comment with the rem command, as follows:

 rem MS OS/2 uses CONFIG.SYS to configure your system.
 rem This command (rem) allows you to insert
 rem comments in CONFIG.SYS that remind you
 rem what a particular command is supposed to do.


 Rename

   ®OS2¯

 rename [drive:][path]filename1 filename2

 Changes the name of a file or directory. You can abbreviate rename as ren.

 filename1                         Specifies the old name of the file or
                                   directory. If you do not specify a drive
                                   and path, MS OS/2 uses the current
                                   directory on the current drive.

 filename2                         Specifies the new name of the file or
                                   directory. You cannot specify a drive or
                                   path for the new name; the rename
                                   command changes only the name of the
                                   file or directory.

 You can use wildcard characters in filename1 and filename2.

 You cannot use the rename command to move files from one drive or directory
 to another.

 If a file or directory with the name specified for filename2 already exists
 in the parent directory, MS OS/2 displays an error message.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 In the high-performance file system (HPFS), you can use the rename command
 to change the case of a filename or directory name by renaming the file or
 directory as itself. For example, you can change the filename
 "mytaxfile.txt" to "MYTAXFILE.TXT" by using the uppercase version of the
 name as the filename2 argument. (The quotation marks around the filenames
 are required when you are using HPFS. For more information about HPFS, see
 the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's Guide.)
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To change the extension of all the files in the current directory in drive B
 that have a .DOC extension from .DOC to .TXT, type the following:

 rename b:*.doc *.txt


 Replace

   ®OS2¯

 replace [drive:][path]filename [[drive:]path] [[/a|/s]|[/a|/u]] [/p] [/r]
 [/w] [/f]

 Selectively replaces files in the destination directory with new versions of
 those files from the source directory, or adds new files to the destination
 directory.

 filename                          Specifies the source file that is to
                                   replace the file on the destination disk.
                                   You can use wildcard characters in the
                                   source-file name to replace groups of
                                   files that have similar names.

 path                              Specifies the directory that contains
                                   the file to be replaced or to which you
                                   want to add the file. If you do not
                                   specify a directory, replace uses the
                                   current directory on the current drive.

 /a                                Adds only the files specified in
                                   filename that do not exist in the
                                   destination directory, and does not
                                   replace existing files. You cannot use
                                   this option with the /s option.,

 /p                                Prompts you for confirmation before
                                   replacing or adding a file.

 /r                                Replaces read-only files as well as
                                   unprotected files. If you do not use
                                   this option and you try to replace a
                                   read-only file, the replacement process
                                   stops and you see an error message.

 /s                                Replaces files in the subdirectories of
                                   the destination directory if the
                                   filenames match those specified in
                                   filename. The replace utility never
                                   searches subdirectories of the source
                                   directory. You cannot use this option
                                   with the /a option.

 /u                                Replaces only the target files that are
                                   older than their corresponding source
                                   files. You cannot use this option with
                                   the /a option.

 /w                                Instructs the replace utility to wait
                                   for you to insert a disk before
                                   beginning to search for source files.
                                   Otherwise, replace starts replacing or
                                   adding files immediately.

 /f                                Specifies that the replace utility
                                   should not discard the extended
                                   attributes of a file if the destination
                                   file system does not support extended
                                   attributes. In this case, the utility
                                   does not replace the file.

 The replace utility is usually used to update the software on your hard
 disk. You cannot use replace to update hidden files or system files.

 The replace utility copies the extended attributes of the new version of the
 file (the source file) to the destination file.

 If you omit the /f option when you use the replace utility to copy a file
 with extended attributes to a file system that does not support extended
 attributes, the utility copies the file and discards the extended
 attributes. If the file requires the extended attributes, replace does not
 copy the file but displays an explanatory message on the screen.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Examples

 To update your phone-list file, PHONES.CLI, in all the directories on your
 hard disk (drive C) with the latest version of PHONES.CLI from the disk in
 drive B, type the following:

 replace b:\ephones.cli c:\e /s

 To add several new printer drivers from the disk in drive A to the directory
 MSTOOLS on your hard disk (drive C), type the following:

 replace a:*.prd c:\emstools /a


 Restore

   ®OS2¯

 restore drive1: drive2:[path][filename] [/s] [/p] [/b:date] [/a:date]
 [/e:time] [/l:time] [/m] [/n] [/f]

 Restores backup files that were created by using the "backup" utility.

 drive1:                           Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   backup disk on which the backup copies
                                   of your files are stored.

 drive2:                           Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   destination disk to which you want to
                                   restore the files. The destination disk
                                   does not have to be of the same type as
                                   the source disk.

 filename                          Specifies the file that you want to
                                   restore. You can use wildcard characters
                                   to specify multiple files with similar
                                   names. If you do not specify a filename,
                                   the restore utility searches the current
                                   directory on the current drive for
                                   filenames that match those found on
                                   drive1.

 /s                                Restores the files in subdirectories of
                                   the directory that contains filename.

 /p                                Prompts you for confirmation before
                                   restoring read-only files or files that
                                   have changed since the last backup
                                   operation.

 /b:date                           Restores only files that were modified
                                   on or before the specified date.

 /a:date                           Restores only files that were modified
                                   on or after the specified date.

 /e:time                           Restores only files that were modified
                                   at or before the specified time. Do not
                                   use this option without the /b:date or
                                   /a:date option.

 /l:time                           Restores only files that were modified
                                   at or after the specified time. Do not
                                   use this option without the /b:date or
                                   /a:date option.

 /m                                Restores only files that have been
                                   modified since the last backup operation
                                   and turns off the archive bits of the
                                   restored files.

 /n                                Restores only files that no longer exist
                                   on the destination disk.

 /f                                Specifies that the restore utility
                                   should not discard the extended
                                   attributes of a file if the destination
                                   file system does not support extended
                                   attributes. In this case, the utility
                                   does not restore the file.

 The restore utility can restore files only to their original directory.

 The restore utility cannot restore CMDsystem files, nor can it restore files
 that are in use on your start-up drive. To restore the backup copies of the
 files on your start-up drive, you must run restore from the MS OS/2 Install
 disk.

 The restore utility restores backup files that were created by using the MS
 OS/2 "backup" utility or the MS-DOS "backup" utility (including versions
 3.21 and earlier of MS-DOS, even though they use a different structure for
 backup files).

 The restore utility preserves the extended attributes of a file or
 directory.

 If you omit the /f option when you use the restore utility to copy a file
 with extended attributes to a file system that does not support extended
 attributes, the utility copies the file and discards the extended
 attributes. If the file requires the extended attributes, restore does not
 copy the file but displays an explanatory message on the screen. Examples

 To restore all the backup files on drive A with the extension .NEW to the
 directory LETTERS on the disk in drive B, type the following:

 restore a: b:\eletters\e*.new

 To restore the files on the disk in drive B to drive C, which is your
 start-up drive, insert the MS OS/2 Install disk in drive A, press
 CTRL+ALT+DEL, press ESC when the logo appears, and type the following at the
 command prompt:

 restore b: c:


 Rmdir (Remove Directory)

   ®OS2¯

 rmdir [drive:]path [...]

 Deletes a directory. You can abbreviate rmdir as rd.

 path                              Specifies the directory that you want to
                                   delete.

 Before you can delete a directory, you must delete all the files and
 subdirectories in that directory. (The empty directory still shows listings
 for the working directory [.] and the parent directory [..] if you list its
 contents with the "dir" command.)

 You can delete more than one directory at a time by specifying each
 directory separately on the same command line.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that in the DOS session you cannot specify multiple directories.

 Example

 To remove the directory BILLS and the directory NOTICES from the root
 directory on drive B, type the following:

 rmdir b:\ebills b:\enotices


 Rmsize (Real-Mode Size)

   ®CONFIG¯

 rmsize=x

 Specifies the amount of memory that MS OS/2 is to reserve for the DOS
 session. To use this command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 x                                 Specifies the size, in kilobytes, of the
                                   portion of memory reserved for the DOS
                                   session. This number must be in the
                                   range 256 through 640. The default value
                                   depends on the total amount of system
                                   memory.

 MS OS/2 uses the first x kilobytes of memory ("low memory") in your computer
 to run the DOS session; memory above x kilobytes is used for the rest of MS
 OS/2 (apart from certain device drivers and essential MS OS/2 functions that
 use a small portion of the first x kilobytes).

 The default size of x depends on how much memory your system has, but it is
 always the largest size possible on your system (up to the maximum of 640K).
 The default size is typically either 512K or 640KÄthe amount of memory
 installed below 1024K.

 The rmsize command sets a maximum amount of memory for the DOS session; if
 there is less than this amount of memory available, the DOS session uses the
 available amount.

 Because the rmsize command affects only the DOS session, it has no effect
 unless the "protectonly" command is set to no (the default setting). (If
 "protectonly" is set to yes, you cannot run the DOS session at all.)

 For more information about setting the size of the environment for the DOS
 session, see the shell command.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 The memory reserved by the rmsize command cannot be swapped, so this memory
 is unavailable to any other program or process.

 Example

 To reserve only 384 kilobytes of memory for the DOS session, include the
 following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 rmsize=384


 Run

   ®CONFIG¯

 run=[drive:][path]filename [arguments]

 Starts a background program when you start your system. To use this command,
 place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 filename                          Specifies the program you want to start,
                                   which must be one that can run in the
                                   background. You must include the
                                   extension (give the drive and path if
                                   the file is not located in the root
                                   directory of your start-up drive. The
                                   file cannot be a batch file.

 arguments                         Specifies any valid options or other
                                   variables for the program.

 You can include more than one run command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 MS OS/2 processes all the "device" commands in your CONFIG.SYS file before
 it starts processing run commands.

 When processing a CONFIG.SYS file, MS OS/2 preserves the difference between
 uppercase and lowercase letters in arguments. This can be important for some
 programs that are case sensitive.

 To run a program that requires input from you, use the "call" command.


 Set

   ®OS2¯

 set [string1=[string2]]

 Defines an environment variable by naming the variable and giving a value
 for it.

 string1                           Specifies the name of the environment
                                   variable you want to set (for example,
                                   PATH, INIT, LIB, or PROMPT).

 string2                           Specifies the string of characters,
                                   paths, or filenames that defines the
                                   current value of the environment
                                   variable.


 If you type set by itself, MS OS/2 displays the current values for all the
 environment variables in the current session.

 If you type set string1=, MS OS/2 removes the current value for that
 environment variable.

 For more information about environment variables, see the Microsoft
 Operating System/2 User's Guide.

 You can also use the set command to define the replaceable batch parameters
 by name, instead of by number. For more information about using the set
 command in batch files and start-up files, see the Microsoft Operating
 System/2 User's Guide.

 This version of the set command affects only the current session.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To set the INCLUDE environment variable so that the Microsoft C Optimizing
 Compiler can find include files in the directory INC on drive C, type the
 following:

 set include=c:\einc


 Set

   ®CONFIG¯

 set string1=string2

 Defines an environment variable by naming the variable and giving a value
 for it. To use this version of the set command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS
 file.

 string1                           Specifies the name of the environment
                                   variable you want to set (for example,
                                   PATH, INIT, LIB, or PROMPT).

 string2                           Specifies the string of characters,
                                   paths, or filenames that defines the
                                   current value of the environment
                                   variable.

 The MS OS/2 installation program places the following set commands in your
 CONFIG.SYS file to specify the search paths to be used by "cmd" and other
 programs (PATH and DPATH) and the location of the command interpreter
 (COMSPEC):

 set path=c:\os2;c:\os2\system;c:\os2\install;c:\;
 set dpath=c:\os2;c:\os2\system;c:\os2\install;c:\;
 set comspec=c:\os2\cmd.exe

 For more information about environment variables, see the Microsoft
 Operating System/2 User's Guide.

 You can also use the set command in your CONFIG.SYS file to define the
 replaceable batch parameters by name, instead of by number. For more
 information about using the set command in batch files and start-up files,
 see the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's Guide.

 This version of the set command affects all OS/2 sessions; it does not
 affect the DOS session.


 Setcom40

   ®DOS¯

 setcom40 COMx=on|off

 Sets the address of the specified serial port so that a DOS application can
 find the port and use it.

 x                                 Specifies the number of the serial port
                                   for which you want to set the address.
                                   This number can be 1, 2, or 3.

 on                                Sets the address of the serial port in
                                   memory.

 off                               Removes the address of the serial port
                                   from memory.


 If you used the "device" configuration command in your CONFIG.SYS file to
 load the COM0x.SYS device driver, you must use the setcom40 utility before
 you run a DOS application. Most DOS applications send their output directly
 to the serial port, rather than through the COM0x.SYS device driver, so they
 must have the port address.

 You must set the port address before you start the DOS application.

 Do not use the setcom40 utility if a program in either the Presentation
 Manager session or an OS/2 session is using the COM0x.SYS device driver to
 control access to the serial port that you want to use. Be sure that any MS
 OS/2 program that is using the serial port (including the spooler, which may
 have files queued up waiting to use the port) has finished running before
 you try to use the port from the DOS session. Conversely, once you have set
 setcom40 to on and given a DOS application access to a serial port, be sure
 that that application has finished running before you switch out of the DOS
 session. Examples

 To set the address of serial port COM2 so that an application can use the
 port in the DOS session, type the following:

 setcom40 com2=on

 To remove the address of COM2 from memory and give access to the port back
 to MS OS/2, type the following:

 setcom40 com2=off


 Setlocal

   ®OS2¯

 setlocal

 Saves the current drive, directory, and environment settings and specifies
 to MS OS/2 that any changes to these settings that you make in a batch file
 are valid only while the batch file is running. Use this command only in a
 batch file.

 After typing setlocal on a line by itself, you can set any variables you
 want for the purposes of the batch file; MS OS/2 restores the original
 settings when it encounters an "endlocal" command or when the batch file
 ends.

 You can use multiple setlocal commands in a batch file without including
 corresponding "endlocal" commands; each succeeding setlocal overrides the
 previous one, in effect acting as an endlocal command for the previous
 setlocal.

 You can use this command only in OS/2 batch files (files with the extension
 Example

 To have MS OS/2 search the root directory of the disk in drive B for
 programs, even though your normal path does not include drive B, type the
 following in the batch file:

 setlocal
 path b:
   .
   .
   .
 endlocal


 Shell

   ®CONFIG¯

 shell=[drive:][path]filename [arguments]

 Specifies the command interpreter that MS OS/2 is to use in the DOS session.
 To use this command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 filename                          Specifies the name of the file
                                   (including its extension) that contains
                                   the DOS-session command interpreter. The
                                   default filename is COMMANDmust include
                                   the drive and/or path if the command
                                   interpreter is not in the root directory
                                   of the start-up drive.

 arguments                         Specifies any valid options or other
                                   variables for the command interpreter.


 The shell command itself does not accept arguments, but if the alternative
 command interpreter does, you can include them as part of the command.

 If you specify a filename other than COMMANDinterpreter you specify when it
 starts the DOS session. Since the DOS commands are included in COMMANDunless
 they are also included in your new command interpreter. Example

 To specify COMMANDlook for COMMANDsize to 512 bytes, and instruct "command"
 to stay in memory, include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 shell=c:\eos2\ecommand.com c:\eos2 /e:512 /p

 COMMANDof the program.


 Shift

   ®OS2¯

 shift

 Shifts the positions of the numbered replaceable parameters (%0-%9) in a
 batch file, so that you can deal with more than 10 values. Use this command
 only in a batch file.

 Each time MS OS/2 encounters the shift command, it discards the value in %0
 and shifts each of the other values to the next lowest replaceable
 parameter: The value in %1 moves to the %0 position, %2 moves to %1, and so
 on. This frees the last parameter, %9, so that the next value you type
 shifts into %9.

 You can use the shift command as many times as you need to in a batch file.
 You can use shift even if there are fewer than 10 values.

 There is no backward shift command. After you have used shift once, the
 value in the original %0 is gone and the batch file cannot use it again.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in a DOS batch file (.BAT extension) as it does in an
 OS/2 batch file (

 Example

 The following batch file (named COPYTOshift command to copy a list of files
 to your current directory:

 @echo off
 if "%1"=="" goto usage
 :start
 copy %1
 shift
 if "%1"=="" goto done
 goto start
 :usage
 echo * This batch program copies any number
 echo * of files to your current directory.
 echo *
 echo * Usage: copyto file1 file2 file3 [...]
 :done


 Sort

   ®OS2¯

 sort [/r] [/+n] < source

 Sorts lines of input in alphabetical and numeric order and sends the output
 lines to the screen.

 /r                                Sorts the lines in reverse order (that
                                   is, from Z to A, then from 9 to 0).

 /+n                               Starts sorting the lines according to
                                   the character in column n (that is, the
                                   nth character from the beginning of the
                                   line). If you do not specify this option,
                                   the sort utility starts sorting
                                   according to the first character of each
                                   line.

 source                            Specifies the source of the input. The
                                   keyboard is the default source, but you
                                   can also redirect a file or the output
                                   from another command. For more
                                   information about redirection, see the
                                   Microsoft Operating System/2 User's
                                   Guide.


 The sort utility uses the collating sequence table that is appropriate to
 the country-code and code-page settings. It does not distinguish between
 uppercase and lowercase letters.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Note

 If you try to sort a file that is too large, the sort utility displays an
 error message. A file is too large if it is larger than 63K or if the number
 of lines is greater than the value ((file size in bytes + 768) / 4). To sort
 a large file, split the file into two or more smaller files.
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Examples

 To sort the contents of the file PHONE.TXT in reverse alphabetical order and
 display the output on your screen, type the following:

 sort /r < phone.txt

 To sort a listing of the filenames in the CLIENTS directory on drive B and
 send the sorted list to the file CLIENTS.LST on drive C, type the following:


 dir b:\eclients | sort > c:clients.lst


 Spool

   ®OS2¯

 spool [/d:device1] [/o:device2]

 Redirects printing output from one device, such as a parallel port, to a
 different output printing device.

 /d:device1                        Identifies the parallel port that is
                                   connected to the printing device. This
                                   is the device that the original printing
                                   command was sending its output to. The
                                   default device is LPT1. You cannot
                                   specify a serial device as device1, but
                                   you can use any parallel device (LPT1,
                                   LPT2, etc.) that supports monitors.

 /o:device2                        Identifies the output printing device.
                                   You can specify any parallel port (LPT1,
                                   LPT2, etc., or PRN) or any serial port
                                   (COM1, COM2, etc.). If you do not
                                   specify device2, the spool utility uses
                                   device1 as the default output printing
                                   device.

 The spooler intercepts files that are being sent by the "print" utility or
 the printing command of an application to a printer connected to a parallel
 port, holds the files temporarily in a directory on disk, and then prints
 them one at a time.

 Because the output printing device can be different from the one speciified
 in the printing command, you can use the spool utility to redirect
 parallel-printer output (for example, to an asynchronous serial device).

 The spool utility affects all sessions. Example

 To spool your print jobs and print them on a serial printer connected to
 COM1, type the following:

 spool /o:com1


 Start

   ®OS2¯

 start [" [/f] [/fs\^|/win\^|/pm] [/i] [/pgm] [drive:][path]command[.ext] [
 options]
 or

 start " [/f] [/fs\^|/win\^|/pm] [/i] "[drive:][path]command[.ext]
 [options]"

 or

 start [" [/f] [/fs\^|/win] [/i]

 Starts an MS OS/2 command interpreter and tells it to carry out the command
 you specify.

 session                           Specifies the name of the new session as
                                   it will appear in the Task List. The
                                   name can be up to 60 characters and can
                                   include spaces; it must be surrounded by
                                   double quotation marks. If you do not
                                   specify a name, MS OS/2 uses the
                                   filename you specify for the command
                                   argument. If you do not specify either
                                   the session argument or the command
                                   argument, MS OS/2 uses CMD

 /k                                Instructs the new command interpreter to
                                   run the command you specify and then
                                   keep the session open when the command
                                   is completed. This is the default option
                                   unless command starts a Presentation
                                   Manager application, in which case the
                                   default option is /n. You cannot use /k
                                   with the /pm option.

 /c                                Instructs the new command interpreter to
                                   carry out command and then end the
                                   session and return to the program from
                                   which it was started. You cannot use
                                   this option with the /pm option.

 /n                                Instructs MS OS/2 to run command without
                                   starting a new command interpreter. This
                                   is the default option when command
                                   starts a Presentation Manager
                                   application. You cannot use /n if you
                                   have enclosed the command and its
                                   options in double quotation marks (see
                                   the following options description), nor
                                   can you use /n if command is a batch
                                   file or attempts to use a batch file
                                   (batch files require "cmd"as their batch
                                   processor).

 /f                                Instructs MS OS/2 to run command in the
                                   foreground. Note that if you use several
                                   start commands in a batch file, you can
                                   use only one /f option; MS OS/2 ignores
                                   all but the first one.

 /fs                               Instructs MS OS/2 to run command as a
                                   full-screen application in the
                                   foreground, in a session independent of
                                   Presentation Manager.

 /win                              Instructs MS OS/2 to run command in a
                                   foreground Presentation Manager window.

 /pm                               Instructs MS OS/2 to run command as a
                                   Presentation Manager application. You
                                   cannot use this option with the /k or /c
                                   option, nor can you use it if command is
                                   a batch file.

 /i                                Instructs MS OS/2 to give the new
                                   session the environment set in your
                                   CONFIG.SYS file. The environment
                                   includes environment variables such as
                                   PATH, DPATH, and the drive and directory
                                   for a session.,

 /pgm                              Specifies that the quoted string
                                   following this option in the command
                                   line is the name of the program to be
                                   run.

 command[.ext]                     Specifies the command you want the new
                                   command interpreter to carry out. This
                                   may be an MS OS/2 command, a utility, a
                                   batch file, or a command that starts an
                                   application. If you do not specify an
                                   extension, MS OS/2 searches for command
                                   with the extensions order.

 options                           Specifies any valid options for command.
                                   If you specify options, you must enclose
                                   command and options in double quotation
                                   marks so that MS OS/2 will not attempt
                                   to interpret the options as belonging to
                                   the start command.

 MS OS/2 runs command as an independent program according to the type of
 application it is. You can override the default start settings by using the
 /fs, /win, or /pm option.

 If you type start without specifying a command, MS OS/2 starts a new command
 interpreter ( "cmd" ) without running a command.

 If the name of the program you want to start must be enclosed in quotation
 marks (if the name contains spaces or characters not allowed in the FAT file
 system, for example) and you do not specify a session name, you must include
 the /pgm option before the program name. If you omit the session name and do
 not specify /pgm, MS OS/2 interprets the quoted string as the session name.
 Example

 To start a new MS OS/2 command interpreter and run an application named
 Videophile in the foreground session, type the following (assuming that the
 command you use to start Videophile is videop):

 start "Videophile" /f videop


 Subst (Substitute)

   ®DOS¯

 subst [[drive1: drive2:path]|[drive1: /d]]

 Temporarily substitutes a drive letter for another drive letter and path.
 While a substitution is in effect, MS OS/2 regards any reference to drive1
 as a reference to drive2:path.

 drive1:                           Specifies the drive letter you want to
                                   substitute for a directory on drive2.

 drive2:path                       Specifies the drive and path of the
                                   directory for which you want to
                                   substitute drive1.

 /d                                Deletes an existing substitution. You
                                   must specify drive1 to identify which
                                   substitution is to be deleted; do not
                                   specify drive2:path with the /d option.

 If you type subst by itself, the utility displays the substitutions
 currently in effect.

 The following utilities do not work on a drive you have substituted for a
 directory on another drive:

 .HP chkdsk 38                     "format"

 .HP diskcomp 63                   "label"

 .HP diskcopy 64                   "recover"

 .HP fdisk /d 74

 The subst utility affects only the DOS session. Example

 To substitute the drive letter F for the path \MONTHLY\FEBRUARY\WEEKENDS on
 the disk in drive A, type the following:

 subst f: a:\monthly\february\weekends


 Swappath

   ®CONFIG¯

 swappath=drive:[path] [space]

 Specifies the location of the swap file that temporarily holds the
 information being swapped from memory if you have enabled swapping between
 memory and disk. To use this command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 drive:                            .LI Specifies the drive on which the
                                   swap file is located.

 space                             Specifies the minimum amount of disk
                                   space, in kilobytes, to leave free on
                                   the swap drive (that is, the disk space
                                   that may not be used for swapping). This
                                   number must be in the range 0 through
                                   32767; the default value is 512.


 The swappath command takes effect only if the "memman" command in your
 CONFIG.SYS file is set to allow swapping.

 For information about swapping, see the "memman" command. Example

 To instruct MS OS/2 to put the swap file in the TEMP directory on your hard
 disk (drive C) and to reserve 1024K of free disk space on the swap drive,
 include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 swappath=c:\etemp 1024


 Syslog

   ®OS2¯

 syslog [/s | /r]

 Suspends or resumes system-event logging. When logging is on, MS OS/2
 records system events in the system log file.

 /s                                Suspends system-event logging.

 /r                                Resumes system-event logging.

 If you type syslog by itself, MS OS/2 starts the OS/2 Logging Facility
 utility and displays its main menu. You can use the /s and /r options if you
 have specified the log command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 The syslog utility affects only the current OS/2 session. For information
 about how to control system-event logging for all sessions, see the "log"
 command.


 Threads

   ®CONFIG¯

 threads=x

 Specifies the number of threads MS OS/2 can run at one time. To use this
 command, place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 x                                 Specifies the number of threads. This
                                   number must be in the range 64 through
                                   512; the MS OS/2 installation program
                                   sets the number to 128. Because threads
                                   take up memory in your system, it is
                                   recommended that you not increase the
                                   number of threads unless your
                                   application tells you to do so or you
                                   receive a message telling you that you
                                   have run out of threads.

 A thread is part of an application or other process that MS OS/2 can
 schedule to run on its own. A process generally contains multiple threads,
 which act like small programs that perform particular tasks in each process.
 Approximately forty of the threads you specify with the threads command are
 system threads that MS OS/2 uses (the number may vary, depending on how your
 system is configured). These threads are not available to applications.


 Time

   ®OS2¯

 time [hours:minutes][:seconds[.hundredths]]

 Sets the system clock by specifying the current time.

 hours                             Specifies a number in the range 0
                                   through 23.)

 minutes                           Specifies a number in the range 0
                                   through 59.)

 seconds                           Specifies a number in the range 0
                                   through 59; the default value is 0.

 hundredths                        Specifies a number in the range 0
                                   through 99; the default value is 0.

 MS OS/2 keeps track of time in a 24-hour format and uses the time
 information to update directory listings whenever you create or change a
 file.

 You may use either colons (:) or periods (.) to separate the hours, minutes,
 and seconds. To separate hundredths, you must use a period.

 If you type time by itself, MS OS/2 displays the current time and then
 prompts you for a new time. If you do not want to change the time, just
 press ENTER.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To set the system time to 1:36 P.M., type the following:

 time 13:36


 Timeslice

   ®CONFIG¯

 timeslice=x[,y]

 Sets the amount of time that MS OS/2 allocates to a thread before checking
 the priority of other threads. Time slices are the units of time that MS
 OS/2 uses to schedule its activities. To use this command, place it in your
 CONFIG.SYS file.

 x                                 Specifies the minimum length of the time
                                   slice, in milliseconds; the default
                                   value is 32.

 y                                 Specifies the maximum length of the time
                                   slice, in milliseconds. This number must
                                   be equal to or greater than x. If you do
                                   not specify y, MS OS/2 uses x as the
                                   maximum length also. If you do not
                                   include the timeslice command in your
                                   CONFIG.SYS file, the default value of y
                                   is 248.


 When timeslice is set to 32 (the default value), the process that is running
 in the foreground receives the most central-processing-unit (CPU) time. For
 more information about this topic, see the "maxwait" and "priority" commands
 and the Microsoft Operating System/2 User's Guide. Example

 To set the minimum length of the time slice to 45 milliseconds and the
 maximum length to 148 milliseconds, include the following line in your
 CONFIG.SYS file:

 timeslice=45,148


 Trace

   ®OS2¯

 trace [on|off] [eventcode|tdf [, eventcode|tdf] [...]] [/p:all|/p:pid[
 ,...]] [/c] [/s|/r]
 Turns the system trace on or off.

 on                                Starts system-event tracing.

 off                               Stops system-event tracing.

 eventcode                         Specifies a single event by using a
                                   decimal code number in the range 0
                                   through 255. You use event codes to
                                   selectively turn on or off the tracing
                                   of specific system events. You can
                                   specify more than one event code,
                                   separating them with commas.

 tdf                               Specifies a trace definition file. The
                                   filename must not include a drive, path,
                                   or filename extension.

 /p:all                            Turns tracing on or off for all present
                                   and future processes in the system.

 /p:pid                            Turns tracing on or off for only the
                                   processes specified. The system
                                   identifies a process by its hexadecimal
                                   process identification number (pid). You
                                   can specify more than one process by
                                   listing all their process identification
                                   numbers, separated by commas.

 /c                                Clears the current contents of the trace
                                   buffer.

 /s                                Suspends tracing temporarily but keeps
                                   the current specified set of trace
                                   points. This option cannot be used with
                                   the /r option.

 /r                                Resumes tracing with the currently
                                   specified trace points. This option
                                   cannot be used with the /s option.

 The system trace records actions, such as hardware interrupts or system
 functions, that MS OS/2 has taken or processed while running. These actions
 are known as events and are identified by event codes. The system-trace
 information can be useful if you are writing a program to run with MS OS/2.

 The trace utility is similar to the trace configuration command. However,
 the trace utility cannot create a trace buffer in which to store the trace
 information. Therefore, the utility does not work unless either the trace or
 the "tracebuf" configuration command is in your CONFIG.SYS file when you
 start your system.

 If you specify an invalid event code, MS OS/2 still traces the other events
 listed but also displays an error message. Example

 To trace events 0 and 1, and no other system events, first type the
 following to turn off the system trace:

 trace off

 Then type the following to turn on the trace for the events you want
 recorded:

 trace on 0, 1


 Trace

   ®CONFIG¯

 trace=on|off [eventcode[, eventcode][...]]

 Turns the system trace on or off. To use this command, place it in your
 CONFIG.SYS file.

 on                                Starts system-event tracing.

 off                               Stops system-event tracing. This is the
                                   default setting.

 eventcode                         Specifies a single event by using a
                                   decimal code number in the range 0
                                   through 255. You use event codes to
                                   selectively turn on or off the tracing
                                   of specific system events. You can
                                   specify more than one event code,
                                   separating them with commas.

 The system trace records actions, such as hardware interrupts or system
 functions, that MS OS/2 has taken or processed while running. These actions
 are known as events and are identified by event codes. The system-trace
 information can be useful if you are writing a program to run with MS OS/2.

 If you do not specify an event code, the trace command turns the system
 trace on or off for all events.

 If you specify an invalid event code, MS OS/2 still traces the other events
 listed but also displays an error message.

 If you include the trace command in your CONFIG.SYS file but do not use the
 "tracebuf" command to specify a size for the trace buffer, MS OS/2 sets
 aside 4 kilobytes of memory (the default size) for the trace buffer.

 You must include either the trace command or the "tracebuf" command in your
 CONFIG.SYS file in order for system tracing to work. Example

 To turn on the system trace for all events except those that have the event
 codes 31 through 34, include the following lines in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 trace=on
 trace=off 31,32,33,34


 Tracebuf (Trace Buffer)

   ®CONFIG¯

 tracebuf=x

 Sets the size of the system-trace buffer, where MS OS/2 stores information
 about system events that are being traced. To use this command, place it in
 your CONFIG.SYS file.

 x                                 Specifies the size, in kilobytes, of the
                                   trace buffer. This number must be in the
                                   range 1 through 63; the default value is
                                   4.

 If you include the "trace" command in your CONFIG.SYS file but do not use
 the tracebuf command to specify a size for the trace buffer, MS OS/2 sets
 aside 4 kilobytes of memory (the default size) for the trace buffer.

 You must include either the "trace" command or the tracebuf command in your
 CONFIG.SYS file in order for system tracing to work.


 Tracefmt (Trace Formatter)

   ®OS2¯

 tracefmt

 Displays the contents of the system-trace buffer.

 The tracefmt utility analyzes and formats each trace record in the
 system-trace buffer and then displays the formatted trace records. (You may
 want to redirect the tracefmt output to a file.) The utility displays these
 formatted trace records, which consist of heading information and other
 trace-event information, in reverse chronological order, starting with the
 most recent event.

 You must create the system-trace buffer when you start your system; to
 create the buffer, include either the "trace" or the "tracebuf"
 configuration command in your CONFIG.SYS file. If you have not done this,
 there is no buffer and the tracefmt utility has nothing to display.


 Tree

   ®OS2¯

 tree [drive:] [/f]

 Displays the path of each directory on a disk and lists all the
 subdirectories (and, as an option, all the files as well).

 drive:                            Specifies the drive that contains the
                                   disk for which you want to display the
                                   directory structure. If you do not
                                   specify a drive, the utility displays
                                   the directory structure of the disk in
                                   the current drive.

 /f                                Lists the names of all the files in each
                                   directory and subdirectory on the disk.


   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To display a list of all the directories and files on the disk in drive B,
 one screenful at a time, type the following:

 tree b: /f | more


 Type

   ®OS2¯

 type [drive:][path]filename [...]

 Displays the contents of one or more text files, in the order specified,
 without modifying them.

 filename                          .LI Specifies the name of the text file
                                   you want displayed. You can specify
                                   multiple filenames, and you can use
                                   wildcard characters to specify groups of
                                   files with similar names.

 If you use the type command to display a file that contains tabs, MS OS/2
 expands all the tabs to eight spaces.

 If you use the type command to display a binary file or a file created by an
 application, you may see unusual characters, such as bells, formfeeds, and
 escape-sequence symbols, in addition to the text.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that in the DOS session you cannot specify multiple filenames, nor can you
 use wildcard characters.

 Example

 To display the contents of the file REPORT.JAN from the disk in drive B,
 type the following:

 type b:report.jan


 Unpack

   ®OS2¯

 unpack [drive:][path]filename [drive2:][path2] [/v]

 Decompresses and copies a compressed file.

 filename                          Specifies the name of the compressed
                                   file. This filename has an @ symbol as
                                   the third character of its extension.

 drive2:                           Specifies the drive you want the files
                                   to be copied to. If you do not specify a
                                   drive, the unpack utility uses the
                                   current drive.

 path2                             Specifies the directory you want the
                                   files to be copied to. If you do not
                                   specify a directory, the unpack utility
                                   uses the current directory on the
                                   specified drive. The utility always uses
                                   the original filename and extension as
                                   the destination filename.

 /v                                Checks whether the sectors that the
                                   files were written to can be read.

 The MS OS/2 installation program uses the "copy" command to copy
 uncompressed files from the installation disks to your system and uses the
 unpack utility to decompress and copy compressed filesÄthose with an @
 symbol as the third character of their extension.

 The unpack utility also copies files that are not compressed, so you can use
 unpack to copy a disk that contains both kinds of files.

 The unpack utility uses the date, time, and any file attributes of the
 original, compressed file in the header of the uncompressed file.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To decompress the compressed files on a floppy disk in drive A that contains
 both compressed and uncompressed files and then copy all the files on the
 disk to the root directory of your hard disk (drive C), type the following:

 unpack a:\* c:\


 VDISK.SYS

   ®CONFIG¯

 device=[drive:][path]vdisk.sys [vdisk-size][, sector-size][, entries]

 Directs MS OS/2 to load the VDISK.SYS device driver. To use this command,
 place it in your CONFIG.SYS file.

 When the VDISK.SYS device driver is loaded, it creates a virtual disk
 driveÄthat is, a disk drive simulated in memory. Information stored in
 memory can be accessed quickly.

 vdisk-size                        Specifies the size, in kilobytes, of the
                                   virtual disk drive. The default size is
                                   64K.

 sector-size                       Specifies the sector size, in bytes.
                                   This number must be 128, 256, or 512;
                                   the default value is 128.

 entries                           Specifies the number of directory
                                   entries. This number must be in the
                                   range 2 through 1024; the default value
                                   is 64.

 The maximum size of a virtual disk depends on the amount of available memory
 in your system, up to 4 megabytes. If the virtual-disk size specified is too
 large to fit in memory, the VDISK.SYS device driver will try to make a 16K
 virtual disk. This may result in a virtual disk with a different number of
 directory entries than you specified.

 When you specify a value for the number of directory entries, MS OS/2 rounds
 the value up to the nearest sector-size boundary. For example, if you give a
 value of 43 and your sector size is 512 bytes, MS OS/2 rounds 43 up to 48,
 which is the next multiple of 16 (there are sixteen 32-byte directory
 entries in 512 bytes).

 MS OS/2 recognizes the vdisk-size, sector-size, and entries arguments by
 their positions. If you omit vdisk-size or sector-size, you must type a
 comma before the next argument as a placeholder. (If you include all three
 arguments, you can use spaces instead of commas.)

 You must place the device=vdisk.sys command after any "device=extdskdd.sys\"
 commands in your CONFIG.SYS file. Example

 To set up a 64K virtual disk with 512-byte sectors and 32 directory entries,
 when VDISK.SYS is in the \OS12\DEV directory on drive C, include the
 following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

 device=c:\os12\dev\vdisk.sys ,512,32


 Ver (Version)

   ®OS2¯

 ver

 Displays the MS OS/2 version number.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.


 Verify

   ®OS2¯

 verify [on|off]

 Turns write verification on or off.

 When verification is on, each time MS OS/2 writes a file to a disk it checks
 whether the sectors the information was written to can be read (that no
 information was written to bad sectors, for example) and displays an error
 message if it cannot successfully write the file to the disk. (Verifying
 does not mean comparing the information that MS OS/2 just wrote with the
 information that MS OS/2 just read.) The default setting is off.

 If you type verify by itself, MS OS/2 displays the current verification
 setting.

 This command affects only the current session.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.


 Vol (Volume Label)

   ®OS2¯

 vol [drive:] [...]

 Displays the volume label and the volume serial number of the specified
 disk, if they exist.

 drive:                            Specifies the drive containing the disk
                                   for which you want to know the label and
                                   serial number. You can see the labels
                                   and serial numbers of more than one disk
                                   by specifying more than one drive. If
                                   you do not specify a drive, MS OS/2
                                   displays the volume label and serial
                                   number of the disk in the current drive.

 If you are displaying volume labels and serial numbers for multiple drives
 and MS OS/2 cannot display this information for one of them (for example, if
 one of the drives you specified does not exist), MS OS/2 displays an error
 message and continues displaying the information for the rest of the drives.


 Disks formatted under versions of MS-DOS earlier than 4.0 do not have serial
 numbers.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session, except
 that in the DOS session you cannot specify multiple drive names.

 Example

 To find out what the volume labels and serial numbers are for the disk in
 drive A and for your hard disk (drive C), type the following:

 vol a: c:


 Xcopy (External Copy)

   ®OS2¯

 xcopy [drive1:][path1][filename1] [drive2:][path2][filename2] [/s] [/e] [/p]
 [/v] [/a] [/m] [/f] [/d:date]

 Copies files and directories, including any subdirectories, from one disk to
 another.

 drive1:                           .LI Specifies the drive that contains
                                   the disk from which you want to copy
                                   files (the source disk). You can use
                                   this argument by itself, with path1, or
                                   with path1 and filename1. If you specify
                                   only drive1, the xcopy utility copies
                                   all the files in the current directory
                                   on that drive.

 path1                             .LI Specifies the directory where the
                                   files you want to copy are located. If
                                   you specify path1 without drive1 or
                                   filename1, xcopy copies all files in the
                                   specified directory on the current drive.

 filename1                         .LI Specifies the name of the file you
                                   want to copy. You can use wildcard
                                   characters to copy multiple files with
                                   similar names.

 drive2:                           .LI Specifies the drive that contains
                                   the disk to which you want to copy files
                                   (the destination disk). You can use this
                                   argument by itself, with path2, or with
                                   path2 and filename2. If you specify only
                                   drive2, the xcopy utility copies files
                                   to the current directory on that drive
                                   and uses the original filenames.

 path2                             .LI Specifies the directory you want the
                                   files copied to. If you specify path2
                                   without filename2, xcopy uses the
                                   original filenames.

 filename2                         .LI Specifies the filename to which you
                                   want to copy the file. You can use
                                   wildcard characters to give multiple
                                   files similar names.

 /s                                Copies directories and subdirectories,
                                   unless they are empty. If you omit this
                                   option, xcopy works within a single
                                   directory.

 /e                                Copies all subdirectories, even if they
                                   are empty. If you use this option, you
                                   must also use the /s option.

 /p                                Prompts you to confirm that you want to
                                   create each new file.

 /v                                Checks whether the sectors that the
                                   files and directories were written to
                                   can be read..

 /a                                Copies files that have their archive
                                   bits set, without modifying the archive
                                   bit of the original file.

 /m                                Copies files that have their archive
                                   bits set and turns off the archive bit
                                   of the original file.

 /f                                Specifies that the xcopy utility should
                                   not discard the extended attributes of a
                                   file if the destination file system does
                                   not support extended attributes. In this
                                   case, the utility does not copy the file.

 /d:date                           Copies files that were modified on or
                                   after the specified date. The format of
                                   date depends on the country code you are
                                   using; the default format is mm-dd-yy.

 All files or directories created by the xcopy utility have the same extended
 attributes as the original files or directories.

 If you omit the /f option when you use the xcopy utility to copy a file with
 extended attributes to a file system that does not support extended
 attributes, the utility copies the file and discards the extended
 attributes. If the file requires the extended attributes, xcopy does not
 copy the file but displays an explanatory message on the screen.

   ®DOS¯

 Works the same way in the DOS session as it does in an OS/2 session.

 Example

 To copy all the files, directories, and subdirectories, even empty ones, on
 the disk in drive A to the disk in drive B, and to verify each file as it is
 copied, type the following:

 xcopy a:\e b: /s /e /v
