## Q57672: Menus Cannot Have Zero Items in BASIC PDS 7.00 UI Toolbox

	Article: Q57672
	Version(s): 7.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S900108-113
	Last Modified: 14-JAN-1990
	
	The User Interface (UI) Toolbox routines provided with Microsoft BASIC
	Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 do not allow menus
	without menu items.
	
	Because of this design, it is necessary to always have menu items to
	choose from. It may be possible to alter the source for the menu
	routines (MENU.BAS) and change the functionality to add the ability
	for menus without items.
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a
	future release.
