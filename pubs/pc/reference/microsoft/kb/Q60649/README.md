	   MENU.H             turtle graphics. The MENU and TURTLE modules
	   TURTLE.C           are independent modules that could be used
	   TURTLE.H           in your own programs. Real mode only.
	
	   CHRTDEMO.MAK       CHRTDEMO illustrates presentation graphics
	   CHRTDEMO.C         techniques. You can use this program as a tool
	   CHRTSUPT.C         for testing different modes and options before
	   CHRTDEMO.H         building them into your own programs. Real mode
	                      only.
	
	   SORTDEMO.C         Visually illustrates six different sorting
	                      algorithms. The source code demonstrates how
	                      to make OS/2 calls. Real or protect mode.
	
	   SNAP.C             Runs in the background and saves the current

	   INCLUDE.C          A PWB extension file that implements an include
	                      command that finds and opens include files.
	
	   TXTFMT.C           A PWB extension file that implements various
	                      commands related to text formatting. You can use
	                      these commands to format paragraphs, center
	                      text, change case, and insert or delete tab
	                      spaces.
	
	   FILTER.C           A PWB extension file that implements a filter
	                      command. You can use it to replace a block of
	                      text with the output of a user-specified
	                      filter (such as the DOS SORT program).
