	The current Mouse Setup disk contained in the EasyCad and MS
	Paintbrush software includes the mouse driver for Windows Version 1.01
	owners.
	
	   Because the Windows Version 1.01 mouse driver does not recognize
	mice with InPort hardware, Microsoft has included an updated MOUSE.DRV
	file to resolve the problem.
	   Copy the MOUSE.DRV file to your Windows Install disk and reinstall
	the Windows software. If you have Windows Version 1.03 or a newer
	version, you will not have this problem.
