## Q58019: BC 6.00 User's Guide, NOVGA.OBJ Affects SCREENs 11-13, Not 3

	Article: Q58019
	Version(s): 6.00 6.00b | 6.00 6.00b
	Operating System: MS-DOS     | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr SR# S900121-5
	Last Modified: 2-FEB-1990
	
	On Page 10 of the "Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.0: User's Guide," Table
	3.1 incorrectly states that NOVGA.OBJ removes support for screen mode
	3 features. The chart should actually show the following:
	
	   NOVGA.OBJ    Video Graphics Array (VGA) features (screen modes
	                11, 12, and 13) absent.
	
	This correction applies to the user's guide for Microsoft BASIC
	Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
	
	This documentation error was corrected in the documentation for
	Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for
	MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
