## Q34113: Use CONST N=45, Not CONT N=45, Documentation Error in 4.00

	Article: Q34113
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 13-DEC-1989
	
	The following correction applies to Page 25 of the following manuals:
	
	1. "Microsoft QuickBASIC Version 4.0: BASIC Language Reference"
	   manual for Versions 4.00 and 4.00b
	
	2. "Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.0: BASIC Language Reference" for
	   Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2
	
	The example for the symbolic constant on Page 25 should read
	
	   CONST N=45
	
	instead of:
	
	   CONT N=45
	
	This information was corrected in the documentation for Microsoft
	QuickBASIC 4.50 and Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00.
