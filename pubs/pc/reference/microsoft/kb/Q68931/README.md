	The Microsoft Mouse can be successfully used with the application Open
	Access III by performing the following steps:
	
	1. Copy the Open Access III files MMENU.DEF and MMENU.MNU to the
	   MOUSE1 subdirectory.
	
	2. Copy the file MENU.COM to the MOUSE1 subdirectory.
	
	3. Load the Microsoft Mouse driver.
	
	4. Go to the MOUSE1 subdirectory and type:
	
	      MENU MMENU
	
	   You should get a "Menu Installed" message.
	
	5. Go to the Open Access III subdirectory and start the Open Access
	   III program.
	
	If this sequence does not work, you may have problems with memory
	resident software. In which case, perform the above steps after doing a
	"clean boot" with a copy of the original DOS floppy disk.
	
	You may obtain the MENU.COM program by calling Microsoft Product
	Support (Hardware).
	
	Open Access III is an integrated function application that combines a
