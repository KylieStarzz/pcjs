	Article: Q63269

	.RTLink is a third-party linker made by Pocket Soft, Inc., that allows
	overlay support for QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, and
	enhanced overlay support for Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
	System (PDS) version 7.00. .RTLink allows the following overlay
	enhancements that are currently not available with QuickBASIC or
	BASIC PDS 7.00:
	
	1. Overlay support in QuickBASIC 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 or BASIC
	   compiler 6.00 and 6.00b.
	
	2. Up to two more additional run-time modules (such as the
	   BRUNnxxx.EXE or BRT70xxx.EXE run-time modules).
	
	3. Multiple overlay areas. Overlays in BASIC PDS 7.00 are limited to
	   just one overlayable area of memory.
	
	4. Overlays calling overlays that use the same overlay area (nested
	   overlay calls).
	
	DISCLAIMER: .RTLink is manufactured by Pocket Soft, Inc., a vendor
	independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or
	otherwise, regarding the performance or reliability of .RTLink. You

	to verify information.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b,
	and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b for
	MS-DOS, and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS)
	version 7.00 for MS-DOS.
	
	The first version of .RTLink that works with BASIC PDS 7.00 is .RTLink
	version 3.11. Earlier versions of .RTLink can create overlays with
	QuickBASIC 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, and BASIC Compiler 6.00 and 6.00b,
	but not with BASIC PDS 7.00. Please note that Microsoft has not tested
	.RTLink with these products and therefore cannot guarantee
	compatibility.
