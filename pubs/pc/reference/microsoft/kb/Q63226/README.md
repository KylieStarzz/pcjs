## Q63226: Internal Processing Error and OS2MOUSE.V12 with Mouse

	Article: Q63226
	Version(s): 1.20
	Operating System: OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 6-JUL-1990
	
	When OS2MOUSE.V12 is installed and the communications manager is
	selected, an internal processing error is detected and the system will
	hang.
	
	To correct this problem, reinstall the mouse driver using the drivers
	that were supplied with the OS/2 package and the system will not hang
	when the communications package is selected.
	
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here as
	it becomes available.
