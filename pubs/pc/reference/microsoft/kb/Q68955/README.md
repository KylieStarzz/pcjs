## Q68955: Using a Bus Mouse on a Tandy 1000

	When using a bus mouse on a Tandy 1000 computer, you may not be able
	to run the mouse on IRQ2. A better choice may be IRQ5, even though the
	computer may have a hard drive.
	
	The early models of the Tandy 1000 used IRQ2 for a hard card, which
	may have been optionally installed. These models included the Tandy
	1000, Tandy 1000A, Tandy 1000SX, and Tandy 1000TX.
	
	Later models used IRQ5 for hard cards. These models included the
	Tandy 1000SL, Tandy 1000SL/2, Tandy 1000TL, and Tandy 1000TL/2.
