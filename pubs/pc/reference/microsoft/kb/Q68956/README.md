	WordPerfect version 5.1 incorporates Microsoft Mouse support; however,
	WordStar versions 5.5 and 6.0 do not. The following information
	identifies whether or not a menu is needed to use the Microsoft Mouse
	with WordStar or WordPerfect.
	
	Product                  Description
	-------                  -----------
	
	WordStar version 6.0     Not Microsoft Mouse aware: see below note
	WordStar version 5.5     Not Microsoft Mouse aware: uses MSWS5.COM
	WordPerfect version 5.1  Microsoft Mouse aware: no menu needed
	WordPerfect version 5.0  Not Microsoft Mouse aware: uses MSWP5.COM
	
	Note:
	WordStar 6.0 sometimes works with MSWS5.  But we do not gurantee this
	version to work with WS 6.0.
	
	It is important to learn how the built-in mouse menus in WordPerfect
	version 5.1 work. In color modes, the normal cursor is a rectangular
	red text cursor. A right-button click causes a menu line to appear at
	the top of the screen. Then, by clicking and holding the left mouse
	button, you may drag the highlight down the chosen drop-down menu to
	make the desired menu selection.
