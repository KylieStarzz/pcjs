## Q58218: QBX /NOF (NOFrills) Option Saves 19K, Not 22K in BASIC 7.00

	Article: Q58218
	Version(s): 7.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr
	Last Modified: 31-JAN-1990
	
	The "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Getting Started" manual incorrectly states
	on Page 15 that the /NOFrills command-line option for QBX.EXE reduces
	memory usage by 22K.
	
	However, the manual correctly states on Page 16 that QBX actually uses
	about 19K less memory with the /NOF command-line option.
	
	This information applies to QBX.EXE in Microsoft BASIC Professional
	Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS.
	
	Please note that the /NOF option for QBX.EXE is unrelated to the /NOF
	(/NOFarcalls) option for the linker (LINK.EXE) in BASIC PDS 7.00.
