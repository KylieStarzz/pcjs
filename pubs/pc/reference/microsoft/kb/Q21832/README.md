## Q21832: Reserved Words Not Necessarily Implemented as Features

	Article: Q21832
	Version(s): 1.00 1.01 1.02 2.00 2.01 3.00 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_BasicCom

	This article discusses why some of the reserved words listed in the
	manual are not implemented in QuickBASIC. For example, LCOPY is not
	supported in QuickBASIC Version 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, 2.00, 2.01, 3.00,
	4.00, 4.00b, or 4.50 for MS-DOS, Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version
	6.00, 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, or Microsoft BASIC PDS Version
	7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2. Another case is where PALETTE and PALETTE
	USING were not supported in QuickBASIC Versions 1.x, but were added in
	Versions 2.00 and later.
	
	Keywords are reserved for reasons of compatibility with past, present,
	and future versions of Microsoft BASIC. A list of reserved words is
	provided to warn programmers not to use keywords used in past and
	present versions of Microsoft BASIC. Some words are on the list but
	not currently implemented or supported because these reserved words
	represent possible additions for future versions of BASIC.
