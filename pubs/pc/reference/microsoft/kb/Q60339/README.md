## Q60339: Reference to &quot;Push&quot; Function Incorrect Editor User's Guide

	Article: Q60339
	Version(s): 1.00   | 1.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr
	Last Modified: 17-JUL-1990
	
	On Page 61 of the "Microsoft Editor User's Guide" for Microsoft C
	5.10, there is a documentation error. It is stated that the Boolean
	switch Savescreen is "for use with the Push and Exit functions." Since
	there is no "Push" function, this should read "for use with the Shell
	and Exit functions."
