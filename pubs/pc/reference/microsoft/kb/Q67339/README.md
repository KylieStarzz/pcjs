	To use the Microsoft Serial Mouse with Timeline, a Symantec
	Corporation project management application, load the mouse driver by
	invoking MOUSE.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file. Symantec Corporation
	technical support confirms that the Microsoft Mouse will not work
	correctly with Timeline if you use the MOUSE.COM driver file.
