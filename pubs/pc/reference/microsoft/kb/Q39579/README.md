## Q39579: How to Get an Earlier Version of QuickBASIC for MS-DOS

	Article: Q39579
	Version(s): 2.01 3.00 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S881202-8
	Last Modified: 19-JUN-1989
	
	If you need an earlier version of Microsoft QuickBASIC because the
	latest version does not help you and a previous version is known to
	solve the problem(s), you can obtain one by calling Microsoft Customer
	Service at (206) 882-8088 between 6 AM and 5:30 PM Pacific time.
	
	Microsoft normally only sells the most current version of QuickBASIC,
	but Microsoft Customer Service may have earlier versions available. As
	of December 1988, the following QuickBASIC versions are available from
	the Microsoft Customer Service Department:
	
	   Version 2.01
	   Version 3.00
	   Version 4.00
	   Version 4.00b
	   Version 4.50
	
	You may be asked to return your current version for a "down grade," or
	if you can't return your current version, you may have to purchase the
	earlier version.
	
	Please confirm availability, charges, and conditions by calling the
	Microsoft Customer Service Department.
	
	You can also check your local dealer or software discount companies to
	see if they have any earlier versions.
