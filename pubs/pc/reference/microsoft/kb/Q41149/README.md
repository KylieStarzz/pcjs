## Q41149: Single Precision Numbers Have 1 to 7 Digits; Double Have 8+

	Article: Q41149
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr B_BasicCom  SR# S890208-209

	The documentation below should be changed to say that a constant is
	single precision if it has fewer than eight digits and is double
	precision if it has eight or more digits.
	
	This correction applies to the following documentation:
	
	1. Page 24 of "Microsoft QuickBASIC: BASIC Language Reference" manual
	   for Versions 4.00 and 4.00b for MS-DOS.
	
	2. Page 24 of "Microsoft BASIC Compiler: BASIC Language Reference" for
	   Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS OS/2 and MS-DOS. (Note: This is the
	   same as QuickBASIC's language reference manual.)
	
	3. Page 18 of the "Microsoft QuickBASIC: BASIC Language Reference"
	   manual for QuickBASIC Version 4.50. This manual must be ordered
	   separately from the Version 4.50 package.
	
	4. The QuickBASIC Version 4.50 QB Advisor on-line help system, when
	   you select "Help - Contents - Data Types - Constants".
	
	The above pages INCORRECTLY state that a number is single precision if
	it has fewer than 15 digits and is double precision if it has more than
	15 digits.
	
	This documentation error was corrected in the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0:
	Language Reference" manual of Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for
	MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
	
	The above products follow the IEEE standard format for storage of
	floating-point numbers.
