## Q39261: Don't Mix .OBJ or .EXE Modules Compiled in Different Versions

	Article: Q39261
	Version(s): 1.00 1.02 2.00 2.01 3.00 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# G881202-7335 B_BasicCom

	When you are compiling a series of BASIC programs, Microsoft
	recommends compiling all associated routines with the same version
	number of the compiler. When the compiler is updated (such as from
	version 4.00 to version 4.00b, or version 4.00b to version 4.50), it
	is best to re-compile each routine with the new compiler and link with
	the new run-time module libraries. Both code generated by the compiler
	and the BASIC run-time modules may change between versions.
	
	This information applies to QuickBASIC versions 1.00, 1.02, 2.00,
	2.01, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50; Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions
	5.35 and 5.36 for MS-DOS; Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.00 and 6.00b for
	MS-DOS and MS OS/2; and Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
	System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
