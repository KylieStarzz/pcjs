## Q28962: Missing Text: DECLARE Statement

	Article: Q28962
	Version(s): 6.00 6.00b | 6.00 6.00b
	Operating System: MS-DOS     | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr
	Last Modified: 2-FEB-1990
	
	There is a documentation error on Page 43 of the "Microsoft BASIC
	Compiler 6.0: Programming in BASIC: Selected Topics" manual for
	Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS
	OS/2. The last sentence of the first paragraph in the Note that
	appears in the center of the page is missing some text.
	
	The sentence should read as follows:
	
	   A DECLARE statement ensures that only the correct number and type
	   of arguments are passed to a procedure, and allows your program to
	   call procedures defined in separate modules. See the "BASIC
	   Language Reference" manual for more information on DECLARE.
	
	This documentation error was corrected in the documentation for
	Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for
	MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
