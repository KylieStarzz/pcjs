## Q31000: MASM 5.10 RUNME.EXE Does Not Set Up for a Two-Floppy System

	Article: Q31000
	Version(s): 5.10   | 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 12-JAN-1989
	
	The RUNME.EXE on the MASM 5.10 distribution disk labeled "MS OS/2
	and MS-DOS Macro Assemblers" is only for a hard-disk installation; it
	will not set up the product on a two-floppy system.
	   The programmer's guide, Page 9, describes a disk configuration that
	is suggested for a two-floppy system. Copy the files by hand to
	working disks.
