## Q44239: Commodore Colt Limited to 112 Files in a Directory

	Article: Q44239
	Version(s): 2.00 2.01 3.00 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 15-DEC-1989
	
	It has been reported that on the Commodore Colt IBM-compatible
	computer, a disk can have a maximum of 112 files in any directory. On
	most machines, 255 files are normally allowed in the root directory,
	and the number allowed in a subdirectory is only limited by available
	disk space.
	
	This limitation can result in error 67, "Too many files."
	
	This information applies to QuickBASIC Versions 2.00, 2.01, 3.00,
	4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and
	6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for
	MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
	
	This is a problem in the ROM BIOS of the Commodore Colt computer and
	not a problem with QuickBASIC. Contact Commodore Business Machines
	Customer Support at (215) 436-4200 for information regarding the
	availability of a correction.
