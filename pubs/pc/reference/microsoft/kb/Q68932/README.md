	Microsoft Mouse Driver version 7.00 displays a false cursor trail in
	the planet simulation program SimEarth. You may temporarily correct
	this problem by using a /B switch when loading SimEarth (that is
	SimEarth /B).
	
	For a permanent fix you can obtain an updated mouse driver from Microsoft
	Product Support or Microsoft Customer Service.
