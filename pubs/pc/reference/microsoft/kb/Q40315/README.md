## Q40315: QC 2.00 SAMPLES.DOC: Sample Program Descriptions

	Article: Q40315
	Version(s): 2.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: enduser |
	Last Modified: 17-JAN-1989
	
	The following information about sample programs is taken from the
	SAMPLES.DOC file included with the Microsoft QuickC Compiler Version
	2.00.
	
	In addition to the reference and "C For Yourself" manual examples in
	the QC Advisor, the following sample programs are provided with
	QuickC:
	
	   Files              Description
	
	   GRDEMO.MAK         GRDEMO illustrates general graphics techniques
	   GRDEMO.C           including drawing, animation, palette
	   MENU.C             switching, window adjustment, menus, and
	   MENU.H             turtle graphics. The MENU and TURTLE modules
	   TURTLE.C           are independent modules that could be used
	   TURTLE.H           in your own programs.
	
	   LIFE.MAK           LIFE illustrates general C and inline assembler
	   LIFE.C             techniques. In particular, it shows how to write
	   TOOLS.C            entire screens to the screen buffer. The TOOLS
	   TOOLS.H            module contains independent functions and
	                      macros that could be used in your own programs.
	
	   CHRTDEMO.MAK       CHRTDEMO illustrates presentation graphics
	   CHRTDEMO.C         techniques. You can use this program as a tool
	   CHRTSUPT.C         for testing different modes and options before
	   CHRTDEMO.H         building them into your own programs.
	
	   CRLF.C             CRLF is a tool for converting certain files that
	                      can not be loaded into the QC environment. It
	                      removes unwanted control characters and ensures
	                      that each line is terminated by a carriage-return/
	                      line-feed pair. CRLF.EXE is also provided on the
	                      utilities disk.
