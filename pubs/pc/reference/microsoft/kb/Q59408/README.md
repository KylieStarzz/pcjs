	In CodeView Versions 2.20 and 2.30, you supposedly can press the left
	mouse button to highlight the command to be copied, and then press the
	INS key to copy the command. However, this method works only with the
	mouse and not with the keyboard.
	
	On Page 64 of the "Microsoft FORTRAN CodeView and Utilities User's
	Guide" Version 5.0 manual, it incorrectly states that you can copy any
	text that appears in any window. This is incorrect because you can
	only copy text in the command window.
