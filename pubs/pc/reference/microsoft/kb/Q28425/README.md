	When using the Symphony mouse menu, please make sure Symphony is
	set up for "text and graphics separate".
	
	   If you are running Symphony with an EGA, Symphony comes up in green
	for "text and graphics separate" configurations. Combined
	configuration will display in red when Symphony is running.
