## Q41148: CTRL+Q+X Moves Cursor to Bottom of Window in QB 4.50 Editor

	Article: Q41148
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr
	Last Modified: 8-MAR-1989
	
	Table 12.2 on Page 204 of the QuickBASIC Version 4.50 "Learning to Use
	Microsoft QuickBASIC" manual lists a "top of window" function followed
	by its corresponding function "bottom of file."  This corresponding
	function goes to the bottom of the window, not the bottom of the file.
	It should state "bottom of window."
	
	The "QuickHelp" within the QB.EXE editor properly states "bottom of
	window."
