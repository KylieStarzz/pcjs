	When using the Excellerator (a code generation program) with an AT&T
	6312, MS-DOS Version 3.30 must be used.
	
	When any version of DOS earlier than Version 3.30 is used with the
	AT&T 6312 machine and the Excellerator, one of the following symptoms
	may occur:
	
	1. More than one cursor may appear.
	
	2. The mouse pointer may skip pixels as it is moved across the screen.
	
	3. Hieroglyphics may appear.
	
	According to Leading Index, the problem can be corrected by upgrading
	to MS-DOS Version 3.30.
