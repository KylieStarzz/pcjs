	Article: Q59384
	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 1.00 1.01 1.10 1.11
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist1.00 buglist1.01 buglist1.10 buglist1.11

	When using the NMAKE /D and /C switches together, the modification
	date of each file will not be displayed when the date is checked. A
	short description of each switch is described as follows:
	
	   /D  Displays the modification date of each file when the date is
	       checked.
	
	   /C  Suppresses the NMAKE copyright message and prevents nonfatal
	       error or warning messages from being displayed.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with NMAKE Versions 1.00,
	1.01, and 1.10. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here as it becomes available.
