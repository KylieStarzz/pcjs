## Q31468: PATCH87 Gives &quot;Cannot Open IO.SYS&quot; Message

	Article: Q31468
	Version(s): 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 16-JUN-1988
	
	If the instructions in the PATCH87.DOC file for using PATCH87.EXE
	are followed through Step 4 of the "Do I Need to Use This Program?"
	section, and the diagnostic test results in a "Cannot open IO.SYS"
	message, then you must contact the original equipment manufacturer
	(OEM) for more information. It is likely that the IO.SYS file has been
	renamed in the provided version of DOS.
