## Q32812: Literal Character Operator (!) in Text Equate

	Article: Q32812
	Version(s): 5.10   | 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist5.10
	Last Modified: 15-JUL-1988
	
	The literal character operator (!) does not allow a right angle
	bracket to be placed in a text equate. For example, the following
	line will cause an error:
	
	    a     equ    < !> >
	
	   The warning message A4001: "Extra characters on line" will be
	generated by the assembler.
	   Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 5.10. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information as it
	becomes available.
