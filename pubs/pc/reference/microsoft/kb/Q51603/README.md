## Q51603: EXT.H, EXTHDR.H Files Don't Come with BASIC 6.00 or COBOL 3.00

	Article: Q51603
	Version(s): 6.00 6.00b | 6.00 6.00b
	Operating System: MS-DOS     | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_COBOL S_QuickC S_C
	Last Modified: 15-DEC-1989
	
	EXT.H and EXTHDR.H, the files necessary to write C extensions for the
	Microsoft Editor (M.EXE and MEP.EXE), are not included with the
	Microsoft Editor software for the following products:
	
	   Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version 6.00 or 6.00b for MS-DOS and OS/2
	   Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and OS/2
	   Microsoft COBOL Compiler Version 3.00 or 3.00a for MS-DOS and OS/2
	
	As EXT.H and EXTHDR.H are included with the Microsoft C Compiler 5.10,
	the lack of EXT.H and EXTHDR.H will only affect those who are writing
	C extensions for the M.EXE or MEP.EXE editor and using Microsoft
	QuickC.
