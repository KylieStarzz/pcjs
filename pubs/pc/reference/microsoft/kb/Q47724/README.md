	Network license agreements do not exist for any of the Microsoft
	language products. These agreements are currently available only for
	our application products.
	
	According to the licensing agreement printed on the envelope that
	contains the disks, our languages are licensed as single-user,
	single-workstation products and cannot be used by more than one user
	simultaneously. Running off of a network server or installing copies
	on more than one workstation is specifically prohibited by this
	agreement. However, the agreement does allow users to share the
	software if they run it off the same workstation at different times.
	
	In a networked environment, each node on the network that will be used
	for development must have a copy of the product installed on a local
	drive. Work files can be shared over the network, but neither
	compilers nor the associated utilities of a package can be shared over
	the network.
