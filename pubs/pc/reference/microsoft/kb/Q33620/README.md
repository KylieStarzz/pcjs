## Q33620: &quot;Illegal Function Call&quot; on WIDTH 40 with Monochrome Screen

	Article: Q33620
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist4.00 buglist4.00b buglist4.50 B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 20-SEP-1990
	
	An "Illegal function call" error message is generated when trying to
	change the screen width to 40 columns using WIDTH 40 on a monochrome
	screen.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickBASIC versions
	4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS; in Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions
	6.00, 6.00b (buglist6.00, buglist6.00b) for MS-DOS and MS OS/2; and in
	Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00
	and 7.10 (buglist7.00, buglist7.10) for MS-DOS and MS OS/2. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
	
	This problem does not occur in programs compiled with QuickBASIC
	versions 2.00, 2.01, and 3.00.
