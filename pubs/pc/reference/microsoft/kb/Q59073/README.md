	The corrections below apply to the Example program for the CALL
	statement (for calling BASIC procedures) on Page 32 of the "Microsoft
	BASIC 7.0: Language Reference" manual for 7.00 and 7.10:
	
	1. The following incorrect sentence should be changed to say "the
	   24th line" instead of "the 25th line":
	
	      The following example uses the CALL statement to call a SUB
	      procedure that prints a message on the 25th line of the
	      display....
	
	2. The following remark after the LOCATE 24,1 statement should be
	   changed to say "the 24th line" instead of "the 25th line":
	
	      LOCATE 24, 1 ' Move cursor to 25th line of display.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
	System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
