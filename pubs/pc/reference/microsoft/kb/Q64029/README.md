## Q64029: MS-DOS 3.20 Patch Is Missing from C Version 6.00

	Article: Q64029
	Version(s): 6.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr
	Last Modified: 25-JUL-1990
	
	The file PATCH320.DOC, which is supplied with the Microsoft C Compiler
	version 6.00, outlines the steps required to patch IBM-DOS version
	3.20 and incorrectly states that there is information about how to
	patch MS-DOS version 3.20 in the README.DOC.
	
	However, the README.DOC file does not contain information about a
	MS-DOS patch, and the patch files are not included on the C 6.00
	distribution disks.
	
	The MS-DOS version 3.20 patches are available with the Microsoft C
	Compiler version 5.10, on the Compiler Disk 1, as well as with the
	Microsoft QuickC Compiler version 2.50, on the Setup Disk. The patch
	file is PATCH87.EXE, and the instructions are contained in
	PATCH87.DOC.
	
	If you have MS-DOS version 3.20 and do not have a copy of the patch
	files, please call Microsoft Product Support Services and a technician
	will send a copy of the files.
	
	The IBM-DOS version 3.20 patch files are included with the Microsoft C
	Compiler version 6.00.
