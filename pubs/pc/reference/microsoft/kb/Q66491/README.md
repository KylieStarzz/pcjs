	BM0350: QuickBASIC Suggestion Reply Letter
	------------------------------------------
	
	Dear MS-DOS and Macintosh QuickBASIC Customer:
	
	Thank you for your letter and suggestion concerning QuickBASIC.
	Although we are unable to respond to your technical questions by
	letter, we do forward your letters to our QuickBASIC development team.
	This procedure provides developers with customer feedback, which will
	in turn make Microsoft's products even better. Now that we can no
	longer respond to letters (unless solicited by Microsoft), we are
	providing the following new service:
	
	Microsoft now offers a new two-tiered support program for QuickBASIC.
	All QuickBASIC customers will be given two specific phone numbers to
	call. First, our regular toll line is designed to answer questions
	about set up and installation procedures, problem reports, and
	documentation errors concerning our current version of QuickBASIC,
	version 4.50 for MS-DOS and version 1.00 for the Apple Macintosh. You
	can call (206) 646-5101, Monday through Friday (except holidays), 8 AM
	to 5 PM Pacific Standard Time.
	
	Second, customers who have questions should refer to our 900-number
	support line, which is designed to offer support on programming, code
	debugging, and problem solving issues for all versions of QuickBASIC
	earlier than 4.50, and other issues not supported on our QuickBASIC
	toll line. We are offering this 900-number service to provide a higher
	quality of service, extended hours, and a shorter waiting time. To
	access "OnCall(TM) for BASIC," call (900) 896-9999. The cost is $2 per
	minute, and the service is available Monday through Friday from 6 AM
	to 6 PM Pacific Standard Time. To obtain the best possible service, we
	recommend you be at your computer and have your QuickBASIC reference
	manuals and disks handy when you call. Also, please refer to the
	enclosed product assistance checklist.
	
	There are many supplemental sources of information relating to the
	BASIC languages, including reference guides and books published by
	Microsoft Press, or you can contact our "OnCall for BASIC" service at
	(900) 896-9999. Support is also available electronically through
	Microsoft OnLine and CompuServe. One of the features of these services
	is to provide access to the Microsoft Knowledge Base. The Microsoft
	Knowledge Base contains the latest technical information about
	Microsoft language products. For more information about Microsoft
	OnLine, which is designed for software developers, call (800)
	443-4672. For more information about CompuServe, which is the largest
	general online information service for personal computer users, call
	(800) 848-8199.
