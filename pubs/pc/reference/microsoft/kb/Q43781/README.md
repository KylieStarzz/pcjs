## Q43781: MOUSE.COM Solves PS/2 Serial Problems with Ventura Publishing

	Ventura Publisher uses its own mouse driver for the PS/2 - Serial
	mouse. For the bus mouse, Ventura requires the Microsoft Mouse driver
	(MOUSE.COM) to be loaded.
	
	If you are experiencing problems using a PS/2 - Serial mouse,
	reinstall Ventura and select the Bus Mouse option.  This will load
	the Microsoft Mouse Driver rather than the driver supplied by Ventura.
	The problems that your experienced with your PS/2-Serial mouse will
	no longer be present.  You DO NOT need to replace your PS/2-Serial
	mouse to choose the bus mouse option.  Selecting the Bus mouse option
	bypasses Ventura's own mouse drivers.
