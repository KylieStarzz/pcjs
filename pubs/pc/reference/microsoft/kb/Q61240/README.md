	C 6.00 and the ANSI C Specification
	-----------------------------------
	
	The online help for the __STDC__ macro implies that C 6.00 is fully
	ANSI C compatible. While C 6.00 has many ANSI-related enhancements, it
	is not strictly accurate to say that the compiler is fully ANSI
	compatible.
	
	For complete information on Microsoft C 6.00 ANSI compatibility, see
	Appendix B of "Advanced Programming Techniques."
