## Q28681: Serial Mouse May Fail with an Older AT&amp;T 6300

	Article: Q28681
	Version(s): 1.00

	There have been some reports that the mouse driver may not install
	correctly with a serial mouse connected to an older AT&T 6300. Using
	the "/C1" or "/C2" switch often solves the problem. If the problem
	continues, check the ROM date and upgrade the ROM if you are using an
	older one. AT&T recommends Version 1.43 ROM or later. Contact AT&T at
	(800) 222-7278 for ROM upgrade costs.
