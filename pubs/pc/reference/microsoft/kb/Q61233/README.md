	Getting Help on Start-Up Error Messages
	---------------------------------------
	
	Sometimes a program in the C 6.00 Professional Development System may
	encounter an error condition on start-up that prevents the program
	from running.
	
	To find out more about the resulting error message, you can use the
	online help system. Access online help by using the stand-alone
	utility QuickHelp, or by using the Help menu in the Programmer's
	WorkBench (PWB).
	
	To find out about an error message using QuickHelp, at the operating
	system prompt type
	
	   QH cxxxx
	
	where <c> is the error's alphabetic prefix and <xxxx> is the
	four-digit error number.
	
	To find out more about how to view errors from within PWB, choose
	"Errors Help" from the Microsoft Advisor Contents screen in PWB. (The
	Microsoft Advisor Contents screen appears when you choose "Contents"
	from the Help menu in PWB.)
