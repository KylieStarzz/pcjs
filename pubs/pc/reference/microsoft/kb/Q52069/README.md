	The following two corrections apply to the MatSEqn FUNCTION
	(MatSEqnS%, MatSEqnD%, and MatSEqnC%) on Page 506 of the "Microsoft
	BASIC 7.0: Language Reference" manual (for 7.00 and 7.10):
	
	1. Insert the text marked in brackets ([]) into the first sentence in
	   the Remarks on Page 506, as follows:
	
	   The MatSEqntype% procedure solves a system of linear equations
	   contained in [a one-dimensional vector and in] a square matrix...
	
	2. Insert the sentence marked in brackets ([]) after the fourth
	   sentence in the Remarks on Page 506, as follows:
	
	   The first matrix is the square input matrix that contains the
	   coefficients for a system of simultaneous equations. [The second
	   matrix is used to input the vector of constants for that system
	   of simultaneous equations.]
	
	This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
	System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
	
	For an example of using MatSEqnx (Gaussian elimination), query on
	the following words:
	
	   Gaussian and elimination
