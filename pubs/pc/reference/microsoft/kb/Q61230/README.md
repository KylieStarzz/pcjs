	LINK: The /NOG[ROUPASSOCIATION] Option
	--------------------------------------
	
	The /NOG option causes the linker to ignore group associations when
	assigning addresses to data and code items. It is provided primarily
	for compatibility with previous versions of the linker (versions 2.02
	and earlier) and early versions of Microsoft language compilers.
	
	Note: This option should be used only with assembly-language programs.
