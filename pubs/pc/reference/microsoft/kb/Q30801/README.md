	The following information is from the Microsoft Macro Assembler
	Version 5.10 OS2.DOC file.
	
	OS/2 Call Summary
	   The OS/2 calls are listed below. The constant symbols associated
	with each group of macros are shown before the listings. The listings
	consist of the macro name followed by a one-line description. A second
	line shows the arguments expected by the macro. The following symbols
	are used to indicate the type of each argument:
	
	    W     Word
	    D     Doubleword
	    PB    Pointer to byte
	    PW    Pointer to word
	    PD    Pointer to doubleword
	    PZ    Pointer to ASCIIZ string
	    PS    Pointer to structure
	
	   If the macro expects the address of a structure as one of its
	arguments, the structure will be listed below the argument line. See
	the include files for listings of structure fields. The include files
	also contain definitions for constants often passed to specific
	macros.
	   This document makes no attempt to explain the purpose or function
	of the OS/2 systems calls. The calls are described in detail in
	manuals published separately by Microsoft and in some third-party
	books and magazine articles.
