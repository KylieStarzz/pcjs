	Article: Q47725
	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 2.00 2.01
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | s_quickc docerr
	Last Modified: 10-OCT-1989
	
	In the operator precedence table in the on-line help in QuickC Version
	2.00 and QuickC with Quick Assembler Version 2.01, the character
	displayed as the one's complement operator is the minus sign (-). This
	erroneous character should be the tilde (~).
	
	To view the erroneous character, call up QuickC, bring up the help
	menu, go into the contents section, and select operator precedence
	under the "Useful Tables" heading. The minus sign is located in the
	second section above the correctly represented minus sign.
