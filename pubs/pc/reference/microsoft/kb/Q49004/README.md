## Q49004: Some Toshibas Cannot Highlight Text for Edit with QuickC 2.00

	Article: Q49004
	Version(s): 2.00 2.01
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist2.00 buglist2.01 QC
	Last Modified: 10-OCT-1989
	
	With QuickC Versions 2.00 and 2.01 and MS-DOS Version 3.30, Toshiba
	1200 HB cannot select text using SHIFT+<arrow> keys for editing.
	
	The Toshiba T1000 with MS-DOS Version 2.11 behaves in the same way.
	
	To workaround this problem, hold down the SHIFT and CTRL keys, then press a
	letter key (SHIFT+CTRL+<letter>) as follows:
	
	   Key   Function
	   ---   --------
	
	   S     Cursor left
	   D     Cursor right
	   X     Cursor down
	   E     Cursor up
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with QuickC Versions 2.00
	and 2.01. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information as it becomes available.
