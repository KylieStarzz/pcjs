	If you plan to write an application with built-in mouse support,
	obtain the "Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide." The manual
	includes a mouse library (for the Microsoft Compilers) and
	documentation on programming the mouse driver.
	
	Microsoft recommends that you program the mouse driver, rather than
	write your own mouse driver. This will maintain compatibility over any
	changes in future mouse hardware.
	
	If you need to write your own mouse driver, you can obtain the InPort
	Application Note (which is used with the Bus mouse) by calling
	Microsoft Product Support Services at (206) 454-2030.
	
	The Serial mouse protocol may be obtained by writing a formal request
	to our Mouse Product Manager (or contacting our Mouse ISV department),
	giving supported reasons for bypassing our mouse driver.
