## Q32128: Extension Cables for Microsoft Mice

	Microsoft retails a 1.5-meter InPort extension cable. Although the
	cable was designed for the gray-button mouse, we have found, under
	informal testing, that the extension cable works with the new
	white-button mice (serial and bus).
	
	If you decide to make a longer cable, special wire is not needed. The
	Microsoft extension cable uses shielded, 7-conductor, 30-gauge wire. A
	heavier gauge wire might be considered for strength.
	
	If an extension is added to the serial mouse, the cable needs to pass
	the following pins straight through as follows:
	
	   pins 2,3,4,7,20 and shield for the 25-pin D version, or
	   pins 2,3,4,5,7 and shield if using the 9-pin version.
	
	Microsoft is not aware of any special considerations for special
	installation, such as alignment to compensate for cable
	characteristics, special cable termination (R, RC, etc.), needed for
	line drivers, or noise-immunity considerations.
	
	If you do anything to change the mouse cabling, the machine is likely
	to violate FCC Electromagnetic Interference regulations. The computer
	may interfere with nearby television or radio reception. Operation in
	a residential environment is especially ill-advised, and such a
	configuration certainly cannot be offered for sale without extensive
	testing and FCC certification.
	
	Microsoft takes no responsibility for the performance of its products
	when modified or used in a manner other than that intended and advised
	in the manual. Microsoft assumes the customer will comply with all
	applicable laws and regulations, and offers the above advice only on
	that basis.
