	Page 15 of the "Microsoft QuickC Up and Running" manual incorrectly
	implies the setup program completely installs QuickC. The floppy setup
	is intended to install the C run-time libraries and allow you to
	manually configure QuickC to your system.
	
	There are too many variables involved for one generic setup to install
	QuickC effectively on all possible floppy systems.
