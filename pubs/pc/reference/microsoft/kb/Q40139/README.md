## Q40139: NORTON Programming Guide for BASICS (TSR) Fails with QB 4.50

	Article: Q40139
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S881227-28
	Last Modified: 12-JAN-1989
	
	It has been reported that the NORTON Programming Guide for BASICS,
	which is a Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) program, does not work
	correctly with QuickBASIC Version 4.50, but works properly with
	QuickBASIC Versions 4.00 and 4.00b.
	
	Microsoft has not officially tested this product with QuickBASIC and
	makes no guarantees of compatibility. As always, you should be careful
	using any memory-resident (TSR) program with QuickBASIC.
