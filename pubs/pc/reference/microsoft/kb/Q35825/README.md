## Q35825: Undocumented BC.EXE Metacommands That Affect .LST Listing

	Article: Q35825
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_BasicCom docerr
	Last Modified: 17-OCT-1990
	
	Placing the following metacommands into your source file affects the
	list (.LST) file generated by the compiler:
	
	   REM $List
	   REM $linesize
	   REM $title
	   REM $subtitle
	   REM $page
	   REM $pagesize
	
	These metacommands are correctly documented in the "Microsoft
	QuickBASIC Compiler" version 1.0x manual, and are used by the
	BASCOM.EXE compiler in QuickBASIC versions 1.00, 1.01, and 1.02. Note
	that these metacommands do not apply to QuickBASIC versions 2.00,
	2.01, and 3.00, which do not output a source-listing .LST file.
	
	The above metacommands work with the BC.EXE compiler that is provided
	with Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50; with
	Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b; and with Microsoft
	BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for
	MS-DOS and MS OS/2. However, these metacommands need to be added to
	the following manuals:
	
	1. "Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.0: BASIC Language Reference," Appendix C,
	   "Metacommands," for versions 4.00 and 4.00b
	
	2. "Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.5: BASIC Language Reference," Appendix C,
	   "Metacommands," for version 4.50
	
	3. "Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.0: BASIC Language Reference," Appendix C,
	   "Metacommands," for versions 6.00 and 6.00b
	
	4. "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: BASIC Language Reference" (metacommands are
	   listed alphabetically) for BASIC PDS versions 7.00 and 7.10.
	
	   REM $LIST{+ -}
	
	The $LIST metacommand turns on and off portions of the source listing
	generated by the compiler. The $LIST metacommand has no effect on
	whether or not a source code listing is produced; it only affects what
	parts of the source code are placed in the listing. A source code
	listing is produced only if you request it when you start the
	compiler. To turn source code listing off at any point in the program,
	add the following line:
	
	   REM $LIST-
	
	To turn source code listing on at any point in the program, add the
	following line:
	
	   REM $LIST+
	
	The following metacommand sets the width of the listing output. Its
	default is 80 characters:
	
	   REM $LINESIZE:n
	
	The following is an example of how to set the list file to 132
	columns:
	
	   REM $LINESIZE:132
	
	The following metacommand places a title on each page of the list
	(.LST) file:
	
	   REM $TITLE:'text'
	
	The following metacommand places a subtitle on all pages except the
	first:
	
	   REM $SUBTITLE:'text'
	
	The following metacommand forces a new page in the compiler listing
	file:
	
	   REM $Page
	
	The following metacommand forces a new page in the compiler listing
	after n minus 6 lines have been printed.
	
	   REM $Pagesize:n
