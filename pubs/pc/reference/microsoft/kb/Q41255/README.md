	The number of serial ports that can be supported under OS/2 is
	dependent on how your OS/2 vendor set up the device drivers
	shipped with the operating system. Most are set up with two ports for
	AT-type machines and three for PS/2 type machines. Each vendor writes
	its own communications device drivers, so it really depends on what
	the vendor is doing.
	
	Note: Both original and third-party vendors can support additional
	ports (essentially, as many as they like) if they write or modify
	device drivers to do so.
