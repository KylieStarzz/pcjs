	Note on Naming Conventions
	--------------------------
	
	The example programs use a subset of the naming conventions used in
	OS/2 and Windows include files. In this convention, the first
	character of an identifier is a lowercase letter called a prefix.
	Common prefixes include p (pointer), a (array), i (index), and c
	(count). After the prefix, there may be an additional lowercase tag,
	usually indicating type. Common tags include ch (char), f (flag), sz
	(zero-terminated string) l (long), and x or y (x or y coordinate).
	Following this there may be one or more qualifiers, each beginning
	with an uppercase letter. For example, an identifier called
	achFileName is an array (a) of characters (ch) containing a filename
	(FileName).
