## Q34361: Making Backup Copies

	Page 7 in Section 1.1.1 "Making Backup Copies" of the "Microsoft
	Macro Assembler User's Guide" incorrectly suggests that you "put the
	copies in a safe place and use them only to restore the originals if
	they are damaged or destroyed."
	   The advice should be to use the backups and to save the original
	disks for making future working copies.
