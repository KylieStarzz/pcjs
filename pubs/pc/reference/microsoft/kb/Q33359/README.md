## Q33359: Enhancements to Help Use Procedures in MASM

	Article: Q33359
	Version(s): 5.10   | 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 12-JAN-1989
	
	A series of enhancements were made in MASM Version 5.10 to make
	procedure definitions easier and more high-level-language compatible.
	These enhancements comprise the following:
	
	   USES register-list
	   Parameters
	   LOCAL variables.
	
	   The implementation of the parameters requires a language to be
	specified so the parameter order can be determined (for any procedures
	with two or more parameters). The other enhancements are not language
	specific.
	   However, these features are intended as a package; therefore, the
	extended features are not recognized if no language is specified.
