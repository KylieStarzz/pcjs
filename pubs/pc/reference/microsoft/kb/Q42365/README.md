## Q42365: 43- and 50-Line Modes with the IBM 8514 Monitor

	Article: Q42365
	Version(s): 1.00 1.02
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist1.00 fixlist1.02
	Last Modified: 28-JUL-1989
	
	The Microsoft Editor does not go into 43- or 50-line line mode on the
	IBM 8514 monitor.
	
	Version 1.00 of the Microsoft Editor does not support higher line
	modes with the IBM 8514 monitor. Regardless of the switch setting you
	give in the TOOLS.INI file, it always comes up in 25-line mode.
	
	For example, setting the height:41 or height:48 switch in the
	TOOLS.INI file results in the Microsoft Editor coming up in 25-line
	mode.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 1.00 of the
	Microsoft Editor. This problem was corrected in the Microsoft Editor
	Version 1.02.
