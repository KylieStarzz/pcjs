	file.
	
	Customizing PWB Program Lists
	-----------------------------
	
	You can add your own build information to a PWB make file by putting
	the following line at the end of the file:
	
	   # << User_supplied_information >>
	
	You can then add your own NMAKE description file commands without
	disturbing the information created by PWB's build process.
	
	For more information, consult the online help for the Make menu's Set
	Program List command.
