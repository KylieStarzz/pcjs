	Using CL Environment Variable with PWB May Cause Problems
	---------------------------------------------------------
	
	The CL environment variable is fully supported in version 6.00 of the
	C compiler. However, when building programs from within PWB, you
	should disable the CL environment variable to avoid interaction with
	PWB build settings.
