	On Page 83, Section 6.3, Number 3, in the mixed-language guide of
	"Microsoft C 5.1 Optimizing Compiler CodeView and Utilities, Microsoft
	Editor, Mixed-Language Programming Guide," the following is
	incorrectly stated:
	
	   C recognizes only the first eight characters of any name, so
	   do not make names shared with C longer than eight characters.
	
	This statement is not true. C can recognize up to 31 characters.
