	This article summarizes selected textbooks from Microsoft Press and
	other sources that are useful references for BASIC programmers. This
	information applies to QuickBASIC versions 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, 2.00,
	2.01, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS; to Microsoft BASIC
	Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2; and to
	Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00
	and 7.10 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2. Some references also apply to
	Microsoft GW-BASIC versions 3.20, 3.22, and 3.23.
	
	The following book applies to general Microsoft BASIC:
	
	   "BASIC Computer Adventures"
	   by David Ahl, published by Microsoft Press (1986)
	
	   This book contains 10 sample programs (games) to demonstrate general
	   concepts of BASIC programming. All of the programs in this book are
	   written in standard Microsoft BASIC for IBM PC compatibles
	   (including Microsoft GW-BASIC, IBM BASICA, and COMPAQ BASICA). The
	   programs also work in Microsoft BASIC for the Apple Macintosh.
	
	The following newsletter applies to GW-BASIC and BASICA:
	
	   "The BASIC Teacher"
	   2814 19th Street
	   San Francisco, CA  94110
	
	   This monthly newsletter discusses learning and teaching BASIC. Each
	   issue contains tutorials, problems, solutions, and reviews. The
	   newsletter material is written by the authors of the following
	   book:
	
	   "GW-BASIC Made Easy"
	   by Bob Albrecht and Don Inman, published by Osborne McGraw-Hill
	   (1989)
	
	The following Microsoft Press books apply specifically to QuickBASIC
	for IBM Personal Computers and compatibles:
	
	1. "Microsoft QuickBASIC Programmer's Toolbox"
	   by John Clark Craig, published by Microsoft Press (1988)
	
	   Contains more than 250 subprograms and functions that address common
	   and unusual programming tasks, including the following:
	
	   a. ANSI.SYS screen control.
	   b. Mouse support.
	   c. Pop-up windows.
	   d. Graphics.
	   e. String and bit manipulations.
	   f. Editing routines.
	   g. Engineering, mathematical, statistical, and random-number
	      functions.
	   h. Calendar and time routines.
	   i. Demonstrations and useful routines written in Microsoft C.
	      (This book shows how to write and compile C routines and how
	      to create a Quick library from those routines.)
	
	2. "Microsoft QuickBASIC," 2nd Edition
	   by Douglas Hergert, published by Microsoft Press (1988)
	
	   This is the best resource for programming with QuickBASIC version
	   4.00 for IBM PC compatibles. It provides a concise survey of the
	   new features of QuickBASIC version 4.00. Special emphasis is placed
	   on the editing environment, record structures, user-defined TYPEs,
	   constants, additional loop and decision structures, and recursion.
	   There are six programs to help illustrate QuickBASIC commands,
	   functions, and techniques.
	
	3. "Microsoft QuickBASIC"
	   by Douglas Hergert, published by Microsoft Press (1987)
	
	   This book provides a good introduction to QuickBASIC versions 2.00,
