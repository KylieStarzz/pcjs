	New Statefileread Switch
	------------------------
	
	- The Microsoft CodeView(R) debugger now has a TOOLS.INI switch that
	  controls whether breakpoints, window configurations, and other
	  information is saved and restored from one debugging session to the
	  next. This switch, the Statefileread switch, is set to yes if you
	  want this information to be preserved, and no if you do not.
	
	For further information, see "Configuring CodeView" in the CodeView
	online help. Also, see the description of the /TSF start-up option
	below.
