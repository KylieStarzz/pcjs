## Q43141: QuickC: Locating a Corresponding Brace

	Article: Q43141

	To get QuickC Version 1.00 and 1.01 to show the corresponding closing
	brace of an opening brace and vice versa, position the cursor on any
	closing or opening brace, bracket, parentheses, or less-than or
	greater-than signs, and then press "CTRL+{" or "CTRL+}" (without the
	quotes). QuickC will now position the cursor on the corresponding
	character.
	
	In QuickC Version 2.00 the same functionality is provided, although
	only CTRL+} will invoke the function. CTRL+{ will not have any effect.
