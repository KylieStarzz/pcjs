	Article: Q67162
	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 6.00a   | 6.00a
	Operating System: MS-DOS  | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr buglist6.00 buglist6.00a

	When using the Setup program that comes with the C version 6.00 to
	6.00a update kit on a monochrome system, the selected menu item may be
	invisible. To correct the problem, use the /mono switch as shown in
	the following example:
	
	   setup /mono
	
	This switch is not documented.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the C Compiler version
	6.00 to 6.00a update kit Setup program. This problem does not affect
	the Setup program for any other C 6.00a package. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
