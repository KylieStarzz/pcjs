## Q45895: QuickBASIC 4.50 Conflict with Tornado Notes TSR Software

	Article: Q45895
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S890606-70
	Last Modified: 22-JUN-1989
	
	It has been reported that QuickBASIC Version 4.50 has a conflict with
	the TSR software "Tornado Notes." The reported conflict is a complete
	system lockup (hang), requiring a cold boot.
	
	This apparently was not a problem with QuickBASIC Version 3.00 or
	4.00. The version of Tornado Notes was not listed, but has a Copyright
	of 1986.
	
	Microsoft does not support running QuickBASIC with this TSR program
	and varying problems may occur.
