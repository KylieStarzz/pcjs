## Q40783: Assembly Listing Doesn't Match Generated Code in C

	Microsoft has received several reports that the listings generated by
	the /Fc, /Fl, and /Fa options do not match the actual code in the
	.OBJ or .EXE file, as viewed by CodeView.
	
	In these cases, we have found that the file has been compiled using
	different options when creating the listing than when producing the
	CodeView file. In particular, adding the /Zi option causes some
	changes in the generated code. As we document, /Zi turns off
	optimizations that move code.
	
	If the listing was generated without /Zi, but the .EXE being viewed in
	CodeView was compiled with /Zi, there often are differences between
	the CodeView listing and the printed listing.
	
	Be sure to use EXACTLY the same options when comparing listing files
	with the actual code.
