	Article: Q66288
	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 2.00 2.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | S_QuickASM C assembler Quick
	Last Modified: 24-OCT-1990
	
	Microsoft QuickC version 2.50 and Microsoft QuickC with QuickAssembler
	version 2.51 are two separate products.
	
	Shorthand references to "QuickAssembler" or "QuickC" version 2.51 (or
	2.01) actually refer to the official product name "Microsoft QuickC
	with QuickAssembler version 2.51 (or 2.01)."
	
	The only difference between QuickC 2.50 and 2.51 is the addition of a
	QuickAssembler, to create and assemble stand-alone assembly programs.
	The QuickC portion of the 2.51 product is exactly the same as in
	QuickC 2.50. (Also, the QuickC portion of the 2.01 product is exactly
	the same as in QuickC 2.00.) Thus, QuickC is optionally available
	without the QuickAssembler, but the QuickAssembler is only available
	bundled with the "QuickC with QuickAssembler" product.
	
	Any problems regarding QuickC version 2.50 also apply to version 2.51.
	
	Any problems regarding QuickC version 2.00 also apply to version 2.01.
