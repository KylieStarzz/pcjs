## Q64099: QB 4.50 SETUP.EXE Hanging Problem on Leading Edge Model D

	Article: Q64099
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S900510-44
	Last Modified: 27-JUL-1990
	
	Two separate customers reportedly hung their Leading Edge Model D
	computers after executing the QuickBASIC version 4.50 installation
	program (SETUP.EXE on the Setup/Microsoft QB Express Disk) under DOS
	version 3.20. Microsoft could not duplicate this problem using either
	MS-DOS or PC-DOS version 3.20. The reported problem did not occur when
	the customers attempted installation with the next version of the
	operating system, DOS version 3.21, on their Leading Edge Model D
	computers.
	
	Please note that the SETUP.EXE program for QuickBASIC 4.50 is mostly a
	file-transferring program. To work around the problem above without
	upgrading DOS, you can set up QuickBASIC by simply copying the files
	directly from the original distribution disks.
	
	The QB Express program can also be copied and run from a hard disk. To
	run QB Express, copy all files on the root directory of the
	Setup/Microsoft QB Express disk. Then type LEARN to start QB Express.
