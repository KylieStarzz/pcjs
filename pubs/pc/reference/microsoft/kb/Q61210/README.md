	Use Only Alpha Numeric Characters in PWB Build File Extensions
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	
	To avoid conflict with special characters used by the PWB MAKE
	facility, filenames in a PWB program list or in customized build
	options can only have extensions that contain the following
	characters:
	
	   0-9
	   A-Z
	   a-z
	
	No other characters are allowed in a filename extension.
