## Q57580: What Features Would You Want for a 1-Byte Data Type in BASIC?

	Article: Q57580
	Version(s): 7.00   | 7.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_QuickBas

	Some developers using Microsoft BASIC or QuickBASIC may suggest that a
	single-byte, unsigned data type should be added to BASIC. As of
	Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 or QuickBASIC Version 4.50 or
	earlier, a single-byte data type hasn't yet been implemented. If you
	support this suggestion, please send Microsoft your (customer)
	comments about what you would use this data type for and what kinds
	of operations you would like to see it support.
	
	For example, would you like the single-byte data type to be a fully
	implemented short integer complete with overflow checking and coercion
	to floating point or longer integers for the appropriate operations,
	or would you like to see it implemented as a simple, small, and fast
	data type with a subset of these operations? What are the ranges of
	uses that you can see for such a data type in your programs?
	
	We'd like to know what kinds of uses people envision for a single-byte
	data type before we consider adding the overhead to the product.
	
	Please send in your comments to Microsoft Product Support
	(206-454-2030) so we may forward them to the Microsoft BASIC Program
	Manager. Your input will be greatly appreciated.
