	There have been some reported keyboard problems with Amdek computers.
	One customer, who was originally unable to select text in the QB.EXE
	environment, reported that the key combinations described below worked
	on his Amdek System 88 (XT compatible).
	
	Microsoft has not tested any version of QuickBASIC on the Amdek System
	88 and makes no compatibility claim with Amdek and QuickBASIC. These
	keyboard problems have been reported only for this brand and model of
	computer.
	
	This information applies to QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50
	and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) versions
	7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS.
	
	If you cannot select text when running in the QB.EXE or QBX.EXE
	environment on the Amdek System 88, try the following key
	combinations:
	
	   Normal Key Stroke       Amdek Key Stroke    Operation
