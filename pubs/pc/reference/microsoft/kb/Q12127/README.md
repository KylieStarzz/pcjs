	Question:
	
	Is there a way that I can trap all possible floating point exceptions
	in a C program?
	
	Response:
	
	The C signal() function allows the capture of floating-point
	exceptions.
	
	For more information on the signal() function, see the run-time
	library reference or the online help that accompanies your compiler.
