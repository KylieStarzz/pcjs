## Q28169: Selecting Text in QB.EXE with Nondedicated Cursors on Toshiba

	Article: Q28169
	Version(s): 3.00 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |  B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 18-JUL-1989
	
	The cursor keys that are integrated into the numeric keypad on the
	Toshiba T1100 Laptop's 82-key keyboard cannot select text in the
	QuickBASIC QB.EXE editor unless you first press CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE,
	which acts as a toggle to turn the selecting mode on and off.
	
	This toggle does not work with Toshiba keyboards that have separate,
	dedicated-cursor keys. For more information in this database about
	selecting text with this type of keyboard, query on the following

	   Toshiba Dedicated
	
	The "Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.00: Learning and Using" manual explains
	the keystrokes necessary to edit and select text inside the QuickBASIC
	editor (see Chapter 5 and Appendix D). Due to differences between the
	Toshiba T1100 laptop's keyboard and the standard IBM keyboard, these
	editing commands do not work correctly on the Toshiba.
	
	On the Toshiba T1100 laptop, the CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE key sequence acts
	as a toggle to allow the cursor arrow keys to select text. After the
	text is selected, you must press CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE again to resume
	the original keyboard mode.
