## Q40369: NUM LOCK On; ALT+BACKSPACE Fails on IBM PS/2 Model 50 and 60

	Article: Q40369
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist4.50 SR# S890103-87 ptm235
	Last Modified: 8-MAR-1989
	
	When Microsoft QuickBASIC Version 4.50 is running on an IBM PS/2 Model
	50 or 60, the following key sequences fail if the NUM LOCK key is on:
	
	1. ALT+BACKSPACE fails to UNDO editing (i.e., pressing the BACKSPACE
	   key while holding down the ALT key).
	
	2. ALT+[-] or ALT+[+] fails to size the window (i.e., pressing "+" or
	   "-" while holding down the ALT key).
	
	If the NUM LOCK key is off, the above key strokes perform as
	documented.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 4.50. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information as it becomes
	available.
