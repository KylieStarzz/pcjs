	It has been reported that the MouseTrak mouse will not work correctly
	with QuickBASIC Version 4.50. The MouseTrak mouse was reportedly able
	to work correctly with QuickBASIC Versions 4.00 and 4.00b.
	
	Note: Microsoft has only designed and tested QuickBASIC for use with a
	Microsoft Mouse. Microsoft makes no guarantees about using QuickBASIC
	with other brands of mice.
	
	Microsoft recommends checking with your respective mouse manufacturer
	to see if a more up-to-date mouse driver is available that will allow
	your mouse to work with QuickBASIC Version 4.50.
