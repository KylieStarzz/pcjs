	When attempting to load a Programmer's WorkBench extension through a
	macro definition in the TOOLS.INI file, if the extension file does not
	exist, or is not in the current path, the following error message is
	displayed in a dialog box:
	
	   pwbhelp:  SYS0123:  A file name or volume label contains an
	                       incorrect character
	
	This error message should indicate that the extension file could not
	be found; however, the message is generated by the OS/2 operating
	system's DLL loading code, and therefore, cannot be changed by PWB.
	
	The following error message is generated in the DOS version of PWB,
	which displays this message in a dialog box:
	
	   No such file or directory
	
	To correct the problem, make sure that the directory in which the
	extension resides is in the current path.
