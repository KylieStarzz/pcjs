	Appendix B of the "Microsoft C Run-Time Library Reference" and
	"Microsoft QuickC Run-Time Library Reference" lists routines that are
	specific to MS-DOS. The lists in both references refer to the
	_getcursorposition routine. The routine referred to should be
	_getcurrentposition.
	
	The error can be found in the C run-time library reference on Page
	655. The same error is found on Page 655 of the QuickC Versions 1.00
	and 1.01 run-time library reference. This manual is sent upon request
	to QuickC 2.00 or 2.01 customers who desire a hard copy of the
	reference.
	
	The list shown in Appendix B in the manuals is not included in the
	QuickC 2.00 and 2.01 on-line help references.
