	You can use the Microsoft Mouse with ACT! version 2.0. In order to use
	the mouse correctly, you must first load the generic menu DEFAULT.COM
	or MSMENU.COM. Appendix H-1 of the ACT! "Reference Manual" specifies
	DEFAULT.COM, but the more current MSMENU.COM or MENU.COM work as well.
	
	Copy one of these files to the ACT! subdirectory. The directions for
	ACT! specify that you:
	
	1. Load the mouse.
	
	2. In the subdirectory in which ACT! is installed, type "MSMENU MSACT"
	   (without the quotation marks).
	
	3. After the menu is loaded in this way, type "ACT!" (without the
	   quotation marks). You will now have the use of the mouse in ACT!
	
	The file MSACT.MSE is a menu file that comes with ACT!. If the mouse
	and menu are loaded properly, then the mouse should give basic cursor
	movement with the buttons serving the following functions:
	
	   Button                   Function
	   ------                   --------
	
	   Left Button Click        Same as ENTER
	   Right Button Click       Same as F2 (edit mode)
	   Both Buttons Click       Same as ESC
	
	Note: These button assignments may not work properly in DOS 4.00.
	
	If you do not have a copy of MSMENU.COM, you may obtain a copy by
	calling Microsoft Customer Service or Product Support and ordering
	 "The Microsoft Mouse Supplemental Menus Disk."
