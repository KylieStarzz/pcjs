## Q32764: Segments of Type COMMON Are Incorrectly Overlapped

	Article: Q32764
	Version(s): 5.10   | 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist5.10
	Last Modified: 15-JUL-1988
	
	Segments of type COMMON are combined instead of overlapped. MASM
	should not combine them; it should pass them through separately for the
	linker to handle.
	   Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 5.10. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information as it
	becomes available.
