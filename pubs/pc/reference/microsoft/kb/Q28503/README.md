	The Compaq Portable 3 has built-in hardware that includes a serial
	port and an expansion chassis slot. The serial mouse should work
	properly in the standard serial port. The bus mouse will not fit in
	the only slot available for the expansion chassis, but should fit in
	the expansion chassis slot (this has not been tested).
