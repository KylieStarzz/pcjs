## Q43336: NOTEPAD.COM Doesn't Work with Extended Keyboard

	Article: Q43336
	Version(s): 1.00 1.01 2.00 2.01 2.50 3.00 4.00 5.00 5.02 5.03
	Operating System: MS-DOS

	Last Modified: 12-JUN-1989
	
	NOTEPAD.COM does not work with keyboards that have the extended
	function keys F11 and F12.
	
	No resolution to this limitation is expected because NOTEPAD.COM is
	no longer included with the mouse.
