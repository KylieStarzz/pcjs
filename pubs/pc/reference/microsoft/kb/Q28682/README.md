	Operating System: MS-DOS

	Last Modified: 21-APR-1988
	
	Problem:
	   IBM DisplayWrite 4 does not recognize the Bus mouse with Microsoft
	InPort Device Interface. DisplayWrite 4 supports the serial mouse and
	older Bus mouse (with a 8255 chip), but does not have an upgraded
	mouse driver for the InPort interface Bus mouse.
	   This problem also occurs with IBM TopView.
	
	Response:
	   Because DisplayWrite 4 has custom-made pointing device drivers, you
	should contact your IBM dealer or have the IBM dealer contact
	IBM dealer support.
