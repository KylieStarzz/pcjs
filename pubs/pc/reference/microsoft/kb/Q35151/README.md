## Q35151: WYSE 1400 Keyboard Input Is Not Recognized by QuickBASIC

	Article: Q35151
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 17-OCT-1990
	
	It has been reported that the WYSE 1400, a computer based on the Intel
	8086 processor, is not compatible with QuickBASIC version 4.00 because
	the keyboard cannot be accessed by compiled programs. Although the
	screen is recognized by QuickBASIC, any INPUT or INKEY$ reportedly
	hangs the system. OPENing the "KYBD:" device name as a file does not
	correct the problem.
	
	This information may also apply to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00b
	and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b, and to
	Microsoft BASIC PDS version 7.00.
	
	Microsoft has not confirmed or tested this information. Corrections to
	this information can be reported to Microsoft Product Support
	Services.
