## Q64177: Hot Spot Not Displaced Along Horizontal Axis with Driver 7.04

	Article: Q64177
	Version(s): 7.04
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |  h_menupr menu programming INT33 MF9
	Last Modified: 27-JUL-1990
	
	If mouse driver version 7.04 for the Microsoft Mouse is installed
	without the /Y switch, the hot spot will not be displaced along the
	horizontal axis.
	
	This problem will occur only in programs that use mouse function 9 to
	set the hot spot. Including a /Y switch when installing the mouse
	driver will eliminate this problem.
