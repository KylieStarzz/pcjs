	If you have Flight Simulator and a mouse, you should use the
	MOUSE.SYS file in the CONFIG.SYS file rather than the MOUSE.COM in the
	AUTOEXEC.BAT file that is installed by the mouse setup.
	
	   The Version 6.11 of the mouse driver that uses the MOUSE.COM file,
	may cause Flight Simulator to continuously ask if you have a mouse.
	Using the MOUSE.SYS file solved the problem.
