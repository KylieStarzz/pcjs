## Q35804: .code Directive with Segment Name Documentation Error

	Article: Q35804
	Version(s): 5.00 5.10 | 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS    | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr
	Last Modified: 12-JAN-1989
	
	On Page 89, section 5.1.4, of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler
	Programmer's Guide," the last line of the second paragraph states
	"Name will be ignored if given with small or compact models."
	
	This information is a documentation error. If a name is given with the
	.code directive, a syntax error will be generated by the assembler.
