	Article: Q47985
	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 5.00 5.10 | 5.00 5.10

	When C evaluates more than one function call in a single expression,
	the calls usually are made in reversed or arbitrary order, rather than
	in the stated order. Since there is no defined precedence in C for the
	order in which multiple function calls are made within a single
	expression, the result is compiler-dependent. In Microsoft's products,
	these functions are usually evaluated from right to left.
	
	This occurs in C Versions 5.00 and 5.10 and in QuickC Versions 1.01,
	2.00, and 2.01.
	
	The following code demonstrates this:
	
	void main( void )
	{
	   printf( "First: %d Second: %d", getch(), getch() );
	}
	
	When this code is compiled and run, it returns first the second
	keyboard code that is scanned. For example, if the F5 key is pressed,
	returning first a null character followed by its extended code, the
	program returns "First: 63 Second: 0." The null character that is
	generated by the keyboard first, is written second.
