	Several customers have reported that when running QBX.EXE from
	Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) version 7.00 or
	7.10 on a machine with a Tecmar ROM BIOS version 1.02 or 1.04, if a
	VGA screen is being used, the environment loses color and the system
	eventually hangs or reboots itself.
	
	Tecmar is researching this problem and will provide a free upgrade to
	Tecmar ROM BIOS version 1.11. To obtain this free upgrade, call Tecmar
	technical support at (800) 344-4463.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
	System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS.
