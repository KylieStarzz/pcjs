## Q61588: QuickAssembler Error Messages Are Not in Manuals

	Article: Q61588
	Version(s): 2.01 2.51
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 15-AUG-1990
	
	Error messages for QuickAssembler versions 2.01 and 2.51 are available
	only through online help. The "Microsoft QuickAssembler Programmer's
	Guide" contains no error messages and the "Microsoft QuickC Toolkit"
	manual contains only QuickC compiler, command- line, run-time, LINK,
	LIB, NMAKE, and HELPMAKE errors.
	
	To obtain information on QuickAssembler errors, use the online help in
	the QuickC environment. The following are two different ways to do
	this:
	
	1. Type the error number in the environment and press the F1 key or
	   press the right mouse button.
	
	2. After compiling, when error messages are viewable in the ERROR
	   window, either place the cursor on the error number and press the
	   F1 key or press the right mouse button.
	
	For example, if you want to obtain extra information on the Assembler
	error "A2009: Symbol not defined," type A2009 from within the QuickC
	environment and press the F1 key. A help window will pop up with
	information concerning the A2009 error.
