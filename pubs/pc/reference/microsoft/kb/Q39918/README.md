	The graphics library provided with the Microsoft C Version 5.10
	Optimizing Compiler does not support OS/2 protected mode. These
	graphic functions are written strictly for real mode.
	
	On the Update Page 25 of the "Microsoft C 5.1 Update" section of the
	"Microsoft C 5.10 Optimizing Compiler User's Guide" section 7.2.1,
	there is a list of functions supported in real mode only. All of the
	graphics functions also should be listed.
