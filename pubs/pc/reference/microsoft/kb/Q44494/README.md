## Q44494: QuickBASIC 4.50 Arrays Can Have 60 Elements, Not Just 8

	Article: Q44494
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S890423-1 docerr
	Last Modified: 20-DEC-1989
	
	Appendix C, "Limits of QuickBASIC," on Page 337 of the "Microsoft
	QuickBASIC 4.5: Programming in BASIC" manual for Version 4.50 and the
	QuickBASIC Advisor on-line Help system incorrectly state that there
	is a limit of 8 dimensions for arrays. The actual limit is 60.
	
	Appendix C and the on-line Help system should read as follows:
	
	   Arrays                        Maximum             Minimum
	   -----------------------------------------------------------------
	   Array Dimensions                60                   1
	
	This information was not included in the documentation for earlier
	versions of QuickBASIC or Microsoft BASIC compiler.
	
	This documentation error has been corrected in the "Microsoft BASIC
	7.0: Programmer's Guide" for Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 and in
	the Microsoft Advisor on-line Help system of the QBX.EXE environment
	in Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00.
