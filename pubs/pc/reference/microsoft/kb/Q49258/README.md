## Q49258: No Watch in Debug Menu of QBI.EXE Interpreter Academic Edition

	Article: Q49258
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr SR# S890906-36
	Last Modified: 18-OCT-1989
	
	Microsoft QuickBASIC Interpreter (QBI) Academic Edition Version 1.00
	was shipped in a box that mistakenly shows a picture of Microsoft
	QuickBASIC Version 4.50 screen menus. The Debug menu in QuickBASIC
	4.50 has Watch... features that are not available in the QuickBASIC
	Academic Edition Interpreter (QBI.EXE) Version 1.00.
	
	The Watch... features shown on the Academic Edition (QBI.EXE) 1.00
	package are available in QuickBASIC 4.50, which is a more complete and
	powerful product.
	
	The QuickBASIC Academic Edition Interpreter (QBI.EXE) Version 1.00
	doesn't have any of the following Debug menu features, but QuickBASIC
	(QB.EXE) Version 4.50 does have them:
	
	   Add Watch...
	   Instant Watch...
	   Delete Watch...
	
	Where these menu items appear in the Debug menu on the package
	picture, QBI.EXE actually has Step and Procedure Step options. The
	Debug menu in QBI.EXE actually displays as follows:
	
	   Step                    F8
	   Procedure Step          F10
	   Trace On
	   Toggle Breakpoint       F9
	   Clear All Breakpoints
	   Set Next Statement
