	Question:
	
	Why doesn't Microsoft offer an educational edition of BASIC PDS
	(Professional Development System) Version 7.00?
	
	Response:
	
	Microsoft instead recommends one of the following products for
	educational institutions and people who want to teach modern BASIC on
	IBM Personal Computers or compatibles:
	
	1. "Learn BASIC Now" by Halvorson and Rygmyr, published by Microsoft
	   Press, 1989.
	
	   This is the fastest, easiest way to learn modern QuickBASIC
	   programming. The book includes a disk with the Microsoft QuickBASIC
	   Interpreter (QBI.EXE), the QBI Advisor complete electronic
	   reference, the QuickBASIC Express online tutorial and introduction
	   to the interpreter, and dozens of sample programs. The book teaches
	   BASIC programming step by step.
	
	2. Microsoft QuickBASIC Interpreter, Academic Edition Version 1.00,
	   for IBM Personal Computers and Compatibles
	
	   This product is entirely disk based, without a printed manual. The
	   disk contains the Microsoft QuickBASIC Interpreter (QBI.EXE), the
	   QBI Advisor complete electronic reference, the QuickBASIC Express
	   online tutorial and introduction to the interpreter, and dozens of
	   sample programs.
	
	The above two QuickBASIC Interpreter (QBI.EXE) products have the same
	language features found in Microsoft QuickBASIC Version 4.50 for IBM
	PCs and compatibles. (Note that the QBI.EXE interpreter environment
	has some limitations compared to QB.EXE 4.50).
	
	We found no compelling reason to make a special academic edition for
	BASIC PDS 7.00 since the only features in 7.00 not found in the
	existing QuickBASIC academic editions are all targeted for people
	making professional, commercial applications and are not crucial for
	teaching BASIC.
