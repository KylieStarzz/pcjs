## Q39181: Pascal Version of CodeView Version 2.20

	Article: Q39181

	CodeView Version 2.20 is different for Pascal then the rest of the
	languages. The Pascal version of CodeView 2.20 is the only version
	that has the Pascal Expression Evaluator. The way you can determine
	whether you are running the Pascal version is that Pascal will appear
	under the Languages menu.
	
	If you have multiple Microsoft Languages, you do not have to keep
	multiple versions of CodeView on your system. CodeView Version 2.20 is
	compatible with all of our languages. However, there is one exception
	-- if you are using Microsoft Pascal, make sure you use the version
	that came with Pascal. It is the only version that has the Pascal
	Expression Evaluator and all of the other language evaluators.
	
	To check if the version you have is the Pascal version, invoke
	CodeView and pull down the Languages menu. If it lists Pascal in the
	menu, you are using the Pascal version that is compatible with all of
	the Microsoft languages.
