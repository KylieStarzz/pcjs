## Q66495: Using /F Switch with No Argument May Disable Debug Switch

	Article: Q66495
	Version(s): 2.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist2.50 s_c
	Last Modified: 11-NOV-1990
	
	If you use the /F (set stack size) switch without an argument, you may
	overwrite the next switch on the compile line. In QuickC, the /F
	switch is entered by selecting Compiler Flags from the Options menu
	and then choosing Global Flags.
	
	For instance, if you add /F to the above mentioned screen and select
	the debug build option, the resultant compile line will ignore the
	CodeView option and you will not be able to debug your program. This
	occurs because the /F option is expecting an argument, which is
	intended to be the size you want the stack to be. Instead, the /Zi
	option, which comes next on the command line Quick C generates, gets
	interpreted as the argument specifying the stack size and doesn't get
	seen by the compiler as a compiler flag.
	
	Sample Command Line Generated by QuickC
	---------------------------------------
	
	   QCL /AL /Ze /F /Zi filename.c
	
	To correct this problem, add a number for the stack size.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with QuickC version 2.50.
	We are researching this problem and and will post new information here
	as it is available.
