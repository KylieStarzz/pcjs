## Q41257: What Is the Format of an .EXE File?

	Question:
	
	What is the format of an .EXE file?
	
	Response:
	
	The .EXE file format is documented in a number of places, including
	the "MS-DOS Programmer's Reference." Probably the best documentation
	you'll find is in the MS-DOS Encyclopedia, starting on Page 119. There
	is also an appendix on the new segmented format used by Windows in the
	back of this reference.
	
	The MS-DOS Encyclopedia is an incredibly valuable reference for
	systems programmers. The format is too long and complicated to
	reproduce here.
