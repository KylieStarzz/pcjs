	Article: Q44133
	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 1.00   | 1.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | s_quickc  s_c  h_FORTRAN

	Question:
	
	What modifications must I make to a make file generated by QuickC
	Version 2.00 so that I can run NMAKE on it and use my Microsoft C
	Version 5.10?
	
	Response:
	
	Only a few modifications must be made to allow a make file generated
	by QuickC to invoke C Version 5.10. The following three items need to
	be changed:
	
	1. Change the CC macro from qcl to cl. To do this, locate the
	   following line in the make file generated by QuickC and change qcl
	   to cl:
	
	      CC=qcl
	
	2. Take out references to ilink. The ilink references are embedded
	   into your make file if you have the ilink option turned on in your
	   environment. The following line in the make file
	
	      ilink -a -e "link $(LFLAGS) @$(PROJ).crf" $(PROG)
	
	   must be changed to the following:
	
	      link "$(LFGLAGS) @$(PROJ).crf" $(PROG)
	
	3. Remove any compiler switches in the make file that cl will not
	   recognize. To eliminate this problem, turn off incremental compile
	   in the QuickC environment prior to making the make file.
