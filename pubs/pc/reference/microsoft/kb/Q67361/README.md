	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 1.10   | 1.10

	When using the online help through the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB),
	the help system will crash if you do the following:
	
	1. After entering help, choose Contents.
	
	2. Select the Microsoft Advisor from the list of contents.
	
	3. Select the Programmer's WorkBench button followed by the "Moving
	   Through a File" selection.
	
	At this point a header will appear on the screen and the elevator for
	the window will appear as though it is at the bottom of a page.
	
	The page can be scrolled up and the contents viewed, especially if
	highlighted, but the menu items at the top will be blacked out
	(although they are present). From this point, no further help can be
	accessed.
	
	If you exit help and then reenter, nothing will come up.
	Re-initializing does not reinstate the help system. Only shelling out,
	exiting, and reentering will allow you to access the help system.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Programmer's
	WorkBench version 1.10. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here as it becomes available.
