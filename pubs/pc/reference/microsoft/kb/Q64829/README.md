	The following are some tips for more effectively using the online
	documentation included with the Microsoft C Compiler version 6.00
	Programmer's Workbench (PWB) as well as the Microsoft Advisor
	command-line help system:
	
	1. Finding help on a topic for which the exact name is not known.
	
	   If the exact spelling of a topic is not known, the help for that
	   topic can't be accessed directly (for instance, by using the F1 key
	   in PWB), but it can usually be found indirectly.
	
	   By using the table of contents and selecting links that pertain to
	   the subject in question, the topic can usually be found. To get to
	   the table of contents from within QuickHelp, select the Categories
	   menu, then "C 6.00".  From within PWB, choose the Help menu, then
	   select Contents.
	
	   If you know the general spelling of the topic, an alphabetical
	   index is available by choosing Index from the main contents screen.
	
	2. "Paging" through the online documentation.
	
	   The online documentation can be "paged through" like you would page
	   through a manual.
	
	   In PWB, CTRL+F1 takes you from one topic to the next sequential
	   topic in the help file. In QuickHelp, Choose Next or Back from the
	   View menu to move in either direction.
	
	3. Scanning a list of available topics (as in a printed index).
	
	   There are alphabetical indices for every major component of the
	   product. Just choose Index from the main contents screen and select
	   the appropriate topic.
	
	4. Techniques for using the online help.
	
	   For more information on how to use the help system, as well as on
	   the general organization and structure of the help system, choose
	   Using Help from the main contents screen.
	
	   For additional help, see Chapter 4, "Using the On-Line Reference,"
	   of the "Microsoft C Installing and Using the Professional
	   Development System" manual that comes with C version 6.00.
	
	5. Printing out the online help files.
	
	   By using the HELPMAKE utility, the help files can be decoded to
	   readable text files, which can then be printed. For more
	   information about the HELPMAKE utility, see Chapter 7 of the
	   "Microsoft C Advanced Programming Techniques" manual that comes
	   with C version 6.00.
