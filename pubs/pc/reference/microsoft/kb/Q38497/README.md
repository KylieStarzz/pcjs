## Q38497: Cursor May Disappear in EGA 43-Line Mode Using Logitech Mouse

	Article: Q38497
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |

	It has been reported that when using a LogiTech mouse and QB.EXE in
	EGA 43-line mode, the mouse cursor disappears below the 25th line. The
	mouse is active even though invisible, i.e., it can place the cursor
	at any location on the screen, or make selections in dialog boxes.
	
	When using the Microsoft Mouse and the mouse driver that is included
	with QuickBASIC Version 4.50, the mouse operates properly in 25-line,
	43-line, and 50-line modes.
	
	Microsoft does not claim compatibility of QuickBASIC with the LogiTech
	mouse, or any mouse other than the Microsoft Mouse. QuickBASIC
	requires you to use the Microsoft Mouse with the mouse driver that
	comes on the QuickBASIC disk (or a later version of the Microsoft
	Mouse driver).
	
	Although Microsoft does not claim compatibility, QuickBASIC should
	work correctly with the latest Logitech mouse drivers (such as
	Versions 3.42 and 3.43). Earlier versions such as LogiMouse driver
	Version 3.2 will not work correctly with QuickBASIC. If QuickBASIC
	does not work with your version of the LogiMouse driver, you should
	contact Logitech to determine if an upgrade driver is available.
	Logitech's phone numbers are as follows:
	
	   LogiMouse (415) 795-8500
	   LogiTech, Inc. (415) 795-0427 Technical Support Line
