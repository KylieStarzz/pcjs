	The 400 DPI serial mouse may not install on the 9-pin serial port of
	an Epson Equity LT 386/SX. Epson America has confirmed this and offers
	a patch for this problem. You can obtain this patch from your Epson
	dealer.
	
	Note: Not all Epson dealers may be aware of this problem, but they
	should be able to get the patch from their main Epson supplier.
