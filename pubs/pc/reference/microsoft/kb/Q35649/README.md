	Some graphics cards allow the monitor to go into modes greater than 80
	columns. The Microsoft Editor has a function called Width to allow
	more than 80 columns, however, this function has not yet been
	implemented.
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in
	a future release.
