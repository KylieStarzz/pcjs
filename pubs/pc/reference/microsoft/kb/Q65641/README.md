## Q65641: C1001: Internal Compiler Error: grammar.c:1.138, Line 164

	Article: Q65641
	Version(s): 6.00   | 6.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist6.00 S_QuickC
	Last Modified: 24-OCT-1990
	
	The sample program shown below will generate the following error when
	compiled with Microsoft C version 6.00, with or without optimizations:
	
	   bar.c(6) : fatal error C1001: Internal Compiler Error
	               (compiler file '@(#)grammar.c:1.138', line 164)
	               Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	
	The following error is generated by the QuickC version 2.50 compiler
	when it tries to compile the same code:
	
	   bar.c(6) : fatal error C1001: Internal Compiler Error
	               (compiler file 'gencode.c', line 437)
	               Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	
	Sample Code:
	------------
	
	char foo[7];
	float test;
	
	void bar(void)
	{
	  test+=foo;
	}
	
	The above program is incorrect because it is attempting to do
	arithmetic on incompatible types, a float and an address. If you
	correct this inconsistency then the program will compile.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with C version 6.00 and
	QuickC version 2.50. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here as it becomes available.
