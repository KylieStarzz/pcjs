	If the cursor moves erratically when using the 123.MNU mouse menu
	provided with Version 5.00 of the mouse, make sure no other
	memory-resident programs are interfering. If the problems persist,
	contact Microsoft Product Support at (206) 454-2030 for the 123 Menu
	disk, which includes an updated 123.MNU file.
	
	If you own Mouse Version 6.00, use the MS123-2.COM found on your
	Expert Mouse Menus disk. This supersedes the 123.MNU file.
