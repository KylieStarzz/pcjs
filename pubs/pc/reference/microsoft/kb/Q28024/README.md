## Q28024: EXE May Be Slower in OS/2 Protected Mode than in DOS

	Article: Q28024
	Version(s): 6.00 6.00b 7.00  | 6.00 6.00b 7.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS           | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 2-FEB-1990
	
	Because of the event scheduling in OS/2, programs run under protected
	mode may run more slowly than they did under DOS. This is expected
	behavior.
	
	Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b and Microsoft BASIC
	Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 are all capable of
	compiling programs to run under OS/2 protected mode.
