	Question:
	
	How can I get help on the error messages without actually getting the
	errors?
	
	Response:
	
	You can get help on all compiler errors, compiler warnings, and link
	errors in the following way:
	
	1. Inside the QuickC environment, in the Edit window type "e." and
	   then the error number. For example:
	
	      e.c1015
	
	2. Highlight the error number including the "e.". Make sure NOT to
	   highlight anything before "e" or after the error number.
	
	3. Press F1 or pull down the Help menu and choose Topic. The topic
	   will be e.c1015.
	
	Help on the error will now be displayed.
