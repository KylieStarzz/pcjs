	Version 1.00 of the new white-button mouse is available in three
	varieties; there are no noticeable differences in function or speed.
	The type of mouse you want depends on the available resources of your
	system.
	   The PS/2 Serial mouse will work in any IBM PS/2 mouse port or in
	any standard IBM 9- or 25-pin serial port. The PS/2 Serial mouse is
	recommended if you own an IBM PS/2 machine or have an available COM1:
	or COM2: serial port on your system.
	   The Bus mouse has its own interface card, which includes the
	Microsoft InPort interface. It can be used with any IBM PC, XT, AT, or
	PS/2 model 25/30 with an available 8- or 16-bit slot. The Bus mouse is
	interrupt selectable (2 through 5), and frequently saves your serial
	ports for other uses.
	   The InPort mouse is the same as the Bus mouse except that it does
	not come with a Microsoft InPort interface-equipped interface card.
	You must have the Microsoft InPort interface within your system (e.g.
	the MACH 20 has built-in InPort technology).
