## Q42703: File with Double Underscore Hangs the QB.EXE Environment

	Article: Q42703
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist4.00 buglist4.00b buglist4.50 B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 26-FEB-1990
	
	When a file consisting of only two underscore characters (__) is
	loaded into the QuickBASIC editor, the "Loading and Parsing" message
	is displayed at the bottom and the machine hangs.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickBASIC Versions
	4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, and in the QB.EXE program shipped with
	Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b. This problem was
	corrected in Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS)
	Version 7.00 (fixlist7.00).
