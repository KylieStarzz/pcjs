	BB0353: "Learn BASIC Now" Reply Letter
	--------------------------------------
	
	Dear "Learn BASIC Now" Customer:
	
	Thank you for your letter concerning Microsoft Press's "Learn BASIC
	Now."
	
	"Learn BASIC Now," a Microsoft Press release, is a self-study tutorial
	sold through Microsoft Press. To make "Learn BASIC Now" more
	competitive in the marketplace, the product does not have support
	costs built into the retail price. Therefore, Microsoft is providing a
	900-number support service. Other sources of support include your
	Microsoft Press documentation or using your online help F1 key (if
	possible).
	
	Microsoft is providing support for "Learn BASIC Now" through a new
	service called "OnCall(TM) for BASIC." To access "OnCall for BASIC," call
	(900) 896-9999. The cost is $2 per minute, and the service is
	available Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 5 PM Pacific Standard
	Time. To obtain the best possible service, we recommend you have your
	Microsoft Press "Learn BASIC Now" reference manual and disks handy
	when you call.
	
	We welcome your letters containing product suggestions and feedback on
	documentation. Although we are unable to respond to your technical
	questions by letter, we do forward your letters to the "Learn BASIC
	Now" development team. There are many supplemental sources of
	information relating to the BASIC languages, including reference
	guides and books published by Microsoft Press, or you can call our
	"OnCall for BASIC" service at (900) 896-9999.
	
	Support is also available electronically through Microsoft OnLine and
	CompuServe. One of the features of these services is to provide access
	to the Microsoft Knowledge Base. The Microsoft Knowledge Base contains
	the latest technical information about Microsoft language products.
	For more information about Microsoft OnLine, which is designed for
	software developers, call (800) 443-4672. For more information about
	CompuServe, which is the largest general online information service
	for personal computer users, call (800) 848-8199.
	
	Thank you for supporting Microsoft Press's "Learn BASIC Now."
	
	Sincerely,
