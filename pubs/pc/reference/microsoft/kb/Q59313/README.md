	When using the 400 PPI Serial Mouse with GEM, the mouse cursor jumps
	all over the screen.
	
	When installing GEM, select the Microsoft Bus Mouse option, even
	though you are using a serial mouse. When the bus mouse is selected
	during the installation process, GEM will use the Microsoft Mouse
	Driver that is supplied with the mouse.
