title: "Q66055: Unexpected DOS Error: 14 Generated by Using /INC"

	Article: Q66055
	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | s_quickc s_c
	Last Modified: 24-OCT-1990
	
	Programs linked with the /INC (Prepare for Incremental Link) switch
	cause the following error if the program is executed using the
	Microsoft Windows version 3.00 Run command:
	
	   Unexpected DOS error: 14.
	
	The Run command is located on the File menu in both the Windows
	Program Manager and the File Manager. If the program is run from a
	prompt in real DOS or in a DOS session of Windows 3.00, it executes
	properly.
	
	While this seems like a problem with the Microsoft Linker, Windows 3.0
	is actually at fault here. The use of the /INC switch causes the
	linker to create a segmented executable. When Windows attempts to run
	this .exe, it fails to recognize that it is a full screen application
	(ie: not a windows app) and subsequently tries to execute it as a
	Windows application. This bug has been entered into the Windows bug
	database and should be fixed in a future release.
	
	Note: This may appear to be a problem with QuickC and/or C version
	6.00 if the incremental link option is turned on. In fact, it is a
	linking issue, not a compiler issue.
	
	To workaround this problem, turn off the /INC switch.
