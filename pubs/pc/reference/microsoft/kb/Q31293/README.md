	When using a Mouse menu with WordPerfect Version 5.00, the menu
	opens; however, no text appears at the current cursor location when a
	selection is made. Upon exiting WordPerfect, the characters from the
	menu appear at the DOS command prompt.
	   WordPerfect Version 5.00 has keyboard macros that disable the Mouse
	menu while in WordPerfect. To use a Mouse menu with WordPerfect
	Version 5.00, you must start WordPerfect with the /nk switch. This
	will disable the keyboard macros and allow the Mouse menu to function
	normally.
