	Entering the command Arg *.* Setfile causes M to display a list of
	all files in the current directory.
	   ECH.EXE is a utility used to generate the list of files for ARG
	textarg SETFILE. If this utility cannot be found, you will receive a
	message saying "Bad command or filename." ECH.EXE must be located in a
	directory on the path.
