	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 6.00   | 6.00

	The _emit directive does not function properly in C version 6.00.
	Instead of sending the requested values, a 0 (zero) value is always
	sent.
	
	The QuickC version 2.50 compiler handles the _emit directive correctly
	as does the Quick Compiler option (/qc) in C version 6.00.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in C version 6.00. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
