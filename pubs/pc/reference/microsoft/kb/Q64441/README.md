## Q64441: QuickAssembler Doesn't Generate Debug Information

	Article: Q64441
	Version(s): 2.51
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist2.51
	Last Modified: 12-NOV-1990
	
	The Microsoft QuickAssembler that comes with Microsoft QuickC version
	2.51 does not generate debug information if assembled from the command
	line (either with QCL or NMAKE).
	
	If the file is assembled inside the integrated environment, the debug
	information is generated.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with version 2.51. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
