	Microsoft academic products are the result of our commitment to offer
	Microsoft products at the lowest possible prices for educational
	institutions. Microsoft academic products contain the same software as
	our full-price retail products, with the exception of Microsoft
	QuickBASIC Interpreter Academic Edition. This particular product was
	redesigned around the needs of the student programming courses.
	
	Academic products are available in the three different configurations
	listed below:
	
	1. Packaged for personal use for faculty and students.
	
	2. Ten-packs that contain 10 sets of software and one set of
	   documentation for use in labs, classrooms, departments, and
	   administrative offices. The packs are licensed only for
	   institutionally owned computers and offer additional savings over
	   Microsoft Academic Editions.
	
	3. Microsoft Academic LANs (local area networks) contain software for
	   one network server, which may be accessed by up to 32 users on the
	   LAN. One set of documentation is also included.
	
	For example, Microsoft has made a release of QuickC Version 2.00
	available for schools that differs from the retail package. This
	academic package does not contain the "C for Yourself" text or the
	"Microsoft QuickC Tool Kit" because most classes will have their own
	preferred texts. The only text included in the academic package is the
	"Microsoft QuickC Up and Running" manual. The software in the academic
	package is identical to that in the retail package.
	
	If you have further questions regarding this or any other academic
	releases that Microsoft has offered, contact Microsoft Educational
	Services at (800) 227-4679.
