	MOUSE.COM Versions 6.00 and later are removed from memory unless
	connected to a PS/2 mouse port. The message "Existing Mouse Driver
	Disabled" appears if the mouse is connected to a PS/2 mouse port or if
	other terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) prevent the mouse
	from being removed from memory.
	
	Earlier versions of the mouse driver do not deallocate.
	
	Versions 6.11 and 6.12 are the only versions that are removed from
	memory if connected to the PS/2 mouse port.
