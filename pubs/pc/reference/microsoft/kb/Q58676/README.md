## Q58676: MenuEvent&#36; Should Be MenuEvent, Page 495 BASIC 7.0 Reference

	Article: Q58676
	Version(s): 7.00 7.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S900212-51 docerr
	Last Modified: 8-JAN-1991
	
	On Page 495 of the "Microsoft BASIC Version 7.0: Language Reference"
	manual (for 7.00 and 7.10), the User Interface (UI) Toolbox routine
	"MenuEvent" is incorrectly referred to as "MenuEvent$". This is a
	documentation error, since the correct name is "MenuEvent".
	
	This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
	System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS.
	
	MenuEvent is a SUB in the toolbox file MENU.BAS and is used to poll
	for any menu events activated by the mouse or keyboard.
