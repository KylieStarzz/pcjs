## Q69044: Repackaged QuickBASIC 4.50 Correction; Requires Two Drives

	Article: Q69044
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S910117-22 docerr
	Last Modified: 14-FEB-1991
	
	In the repackaged release of Microsoft QuickBASIC version 4.50, the
	"System Requirements" section on the back cover of the manual
	incorrectly states that a system with "One 3 1/2" disk drive" is
	supported.
	
	The repackaged release of QuickBASIC 4.50 actually requires two disk
	drives (for 3.5-inch disks or double-sided 5.25-inch disks).
	
	In the repackaged release of Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.50, the "System
	Requirements" are presently listed as follows:
	
	   System Requirements
	   * 384 available user memory
	   * MS-DOS or PC-DOS operating system version 2.1 or higher
	   * One 3 1/2" disk drive or two double-sided 5 1/4" disk drives
	
	The first two system requirements are correct, but the third
	pertaining to floppy drive requirements should be changed to read as
	follows:
	
	   * Two disk drives (for double-sided disks)
	
	Although some customers have claimed to be able to run QuickBASIC from
	one 3.5-inch floppy drive, they still had to use a system with two
	floppy drives to run the QuickBASIC SETUP.EXE utility.
	
	The QuickBASIC SETUP utility was not designed to be run using only one
	floppy drive. SETUP will not allow you to do this, even if you
	redirect drives through DOS.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a documentation error in the
	repackaged release of Microsoft QuickBASIC version 4.50 for MS-DOS.
	
	Reference:
	
	The repackaged release of QuickBASIC 4.50 has packed (compressed)
	files on four 5.25-inch disks or two 3.5-inch disks, plus an
	UNPACK.EXE program, and the two manuals are combined into one spine
	and shipped without a box. The previous release had normal (nonpacked)
	files on five 5.25-inch disks and three 3.5-inch disks, and shipped
	with two manuals. The previous release was packaged inside a box.
