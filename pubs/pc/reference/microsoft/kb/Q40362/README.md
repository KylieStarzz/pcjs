## Q40362: Programs LINKed with Incorrect Version of LINK.EXE May Hang

	Article: Q40362
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S890106-58 B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 15-DEC-1989
	
	Programs developed in a particular version of Microsoft QuickBASIC or
	Microsoft BASIC Compiler may yield unpredictable results during run
	time if they are LINKed with a version of LINK.EXE other than the
	version that was shipped with the product. The behavior where a
	program runs correctly in the QB.EXE environment but performs
	incorrectly or hangs in the .EXE executable version may be the result
	of using an older or NEWER version of LINK.EXE.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b,
	and 4.50, Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS
	and MS OS/2, and Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and OS/2.
