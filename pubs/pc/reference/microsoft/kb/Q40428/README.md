	Can I view my code beyond column 71 in CodeView like I can in the
	Microsoft editor?
	
	In CodeView Version 2.20, you cannot scroll your code to the right.
	You should either rewrite the source code or, if you used tabs in the
	source code, reduce the tab size with the # dialog command, as
	described on Page 240 of the "Microsoft CodeView and Utilities"
	manual.
