## Q41324: QHMEP.DLL Remaps Two Keys in MEP Version 1.00

	Article: Q41324
	Version(s): 1.00
	Operating System: OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist1.00
	Last Modified: 16-MAY-1989
	
	Problem:
	
	I have remapped the keys CTRL+S and CTRL+P in MEP Version 1.00 to the
	psearch and up functions. After loading the extension QHMEP.DLL, which
	comes with the Version 1.06 OS/2 SDK, the two keys CTRL+S and CTRL+P
	are not mapped to psearch and up anymore. Furthermore, these keys
	cannot be reassigned back to psearch and up. I seem to be locked out
	of using these keys.
	
	Response:
	
	This problem occurs because the editor is taking over these keys,
	preventing them from being reassigned.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MEP Version 1.00. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information as it becomes
	available.
