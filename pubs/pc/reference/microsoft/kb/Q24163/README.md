## Q24163: Earlier Versions with Mouse Menu Software

	Article: Q24163
	Version(s): 4.x 5.x 6.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 23-AUG-1988
	
	The content of the "Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide"
	is similar to earlier versions of the mouse containing the mouse
	programming.
	   If you are writing standard mouse menus, the commands in the
	"Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide" are the same as they
	were with versions prior to Version 6.00. The major changes include
	better documentation, examples, and updated mouse libraries. If you
	have a version prior to Version 5.03, we recommend that you obtain the
	"Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide" if you are having any
	problems with MENU.COM or MAKEMENU.EXE.
