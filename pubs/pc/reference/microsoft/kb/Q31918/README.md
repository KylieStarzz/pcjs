	Product: Microsoft C

	Incompatibility problems have been reported with Logitech's mouse and
	CodeView. Some of the problems encountered are as follows:
	
	1. The Logitech mouse fails to function correctly with CodeView
	   Version 2.20 when in 43-line mode. The characters within
	   highlighted cells are incorrect until they are unhighlighted.
	
	2. When in either 43-line or 25-line mode, garbage characters are
	   occasionally found at the DOS prompt following an exit from
	   CodeView.
	
	The problems seem to be with Versions 3.20 and earlier of the Logitech
	mouse driver. An update of the mouse driver is available that corrects
	these problems. Logitech can be reached at (415) 795-0427. Logitech
	also has a bulletin board service, which may contain the latest driver
	and can be reached at (415) 795-0408.
	
	A Microsoft Mouse or 100 percent Microsoft-compatible mouse is
	required for use with CodeView. In addition, you must use Microsoft's
	mouse driver Version 6.00 or later, or a driver that exactly emulates
	these Microsoft drivers.
