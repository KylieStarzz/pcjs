	When using the bus mouse with the AT&T 6300 Plus, the J4 jumper
	must be set to either 3 or 4.
	   There have been problems reported while using interrupt 5 with this
	computer; this should be a free interrupt on an AT machine. This
	problem may occur with any program that uses the mouse; however, the
	problem has not occurred with Paintbrush, CPANEL.COM, and DEFAULT.COM.
