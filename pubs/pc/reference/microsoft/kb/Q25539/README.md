## Q25539: Retrieving Previously Entered Commands

	Article: Q25539
	Version(s): 1.00 1.10 2.00 2.10 2.20 2.30 | 2.20 2.30
	Operating System: MS-DOS                        | OS/2

	Question:
	
	Is there a method to retrieve commands after typing them in once? For
	instance, if I type "d some_data_area l 40", I would like to retrieve
	the command without having to retype it. A suggested method would be
	to allow the user to scroll on the command, then press a key to make
	the command active.
	
	Response:
	
	The only way to retrieve commands is to highlight them with the mouse
	and press the INS key. This method inserts the command into the
	command line. We are considering making an easier way to scroll
	through the commands and may implement it in a future version.
