## Q45185: /43 Starts CodeView with Screen Swapping Enabled

	Article: Q45185
	Version(s): 2.20 2.30 | 2.20 2.30
	Operating System: MS-DOS    | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 7-JUN-1989
	
	When CodeView is started with the /43 switch to bring it up in 43-line
	mode, screen swapping is automatically enabled. This behavior is by
	design, although it is not stated in the documentation for the
	product.
