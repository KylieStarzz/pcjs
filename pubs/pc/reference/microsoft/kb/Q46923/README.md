## Q46923: Some ASCII Control Characters Incorrect in Programmer's Manual

	Article: Q46923
	Version(s): 1.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | mouse menu
	Last Modified: 31-AUG-1989
	
	A documentation error on Page 2-24 of "Microsoft Mouse Programmer's
	Reference Guide" incorrectly states that ASCII value 28 corresponds to
	CTRL+\, not CTRL-. This error was corrected in "Microsoft Mouse
	Programmer's Reference" from Microsoft Press.
	
	Control characters CTRL+H, CTRL+I, CTRL+J, CTRL+M, and CTRL+[ are not
	listed in the table on Page 2-24 because their ASCII values are the
	same as ASCII codes for backspace, horizontal tab, linefeed, carriage
	return, and escape, respectively.
