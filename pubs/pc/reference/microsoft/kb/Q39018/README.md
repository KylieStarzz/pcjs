	The information below describes library-error message U1188.
	
	The following error is from "LIB Error Messages" in (1) the manual
	"CodeView and Utilities", Section C.3, Page 373, and in (2) the
	"Microsoft QuickC Compiler Programmer's Guide," Section D.5, Page 379:
	
	U1188       cannot write to VM
	
	(1)         Note the circumstances of the failure and notify Microsoft
	            Corporation by using the Product Assistance Request form
	            at the back of one of your manuals.
	
	(2)         Note the circumstances of the failure and notify Microsoft
	            Corporation, using the Product Assistance Request form at
	            the back of this manual.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTE:  This error can also occur when a temporary file
	cannot be created, possibly because the disk is full.
	
	Error messages generated by the Microsoft Library Manager, LIB, have
	one of the following formats:
	
	{filename | LIB} : fatal error U1xxx: messagetext
	{filename | LIB} : error U2xxx: messagetext
	{filename | LIB} : warning U4xxx: messagetext
	
	The message begins with the input-file name (filename), if one exists,
	or with the name of the utility. If possible, LIB prints a warning and
	continues operation. In some cases errors are fatal and LIB terminates
	processing.
