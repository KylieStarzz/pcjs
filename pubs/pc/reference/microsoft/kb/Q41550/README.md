	README.DOC file, Part 1, "Notes on "Up and Running." " The following
	notes refer to specific pages in "Up and Running."
	
	55  The LEARN.COM Program
	
	The \QC2\TUTORIAL directory holds the LEARN.COM program. You can run
	it from the command line or choose the "Learn QuickC" command from
	QuickC's Utility menu. QuickC searches the current path and runs the
	first LEARN.COM program that it finds, which means that users of
	Microsoft Word may see the MS-Word tutorial instead of the QuickC
	tutorial if the Word directory is first in the path. If this happens
	to you, either switch to \QC2\TUTORIAL directory and type LEARN, or
	run the NEW-VARS.BAT batch file.
