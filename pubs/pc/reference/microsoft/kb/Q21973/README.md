## Q21973: CTRL+BREAK Doesn't Break Program on Tandy 1000; Use CTRL+HOLD

	Article: Q21973
	Version(s): 2.00 2.01 3.00 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_BasicCom

	On a Tandy 1000, running a program from the QuickBASIC editor, the
	CTRL+BREAK key sequence does not break execution of the program.
	
	This is not a problem with QuickBASIC but is rather a nonstandard
	keyboard sequence on the Tandy 1000. CTRL+HOLD should be used instead
	of CTRL+BREAK on a Tandy 1000. This also applies to the Tandy 1000 SX.
	
	This information applies to the QB.EXE environment in Microsoft
	QuickBASIC Versions 2.00, 2.01, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for
	MS-DOS, to QB.EXE in Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b
	for MS-DOS, and to QBX.EXE in Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for
	MS-DOS.
