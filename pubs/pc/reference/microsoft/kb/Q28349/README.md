	The sample programs on Pages 325 and 521 of the "Microsoft C 5.1
	Optimizing Compiler Run-Time Library Reference" manual are incorrect.
	For the _getfillmask and _setfillmask examples, the unsigned char
	array element values should be shown with backslackes "\" preceding
	the x's to indicate that they are hexadecimal values.
