	Question:
	
	Why does my old Vega VGA card cause CodeView to hang when I start it
	in VGA mode? It works properly when I start CodeView when the card is
	in CGA mode.
	
	Response:
	
	Some of the older Vega VGAs do not work correctly with CodeView. The
	Vega VGA card uses the same maskable interrupt for detecting graphics
	mode as CodeView.
	
	We recommend that you contact Vega by calling 1 (800) 248-1850 for
	advice if you experience this problem.
