## Q19915: Windows Versions 1.01 and 1.02 and the Bus Mouse

	Article: Q19915
	Version(s): 3.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS

	Windows Versions 1.01 and 1.02 will hang or will not recognize bus
	mouse Version 5.03 (InPort hardware) or later.
	
	Windows Versions 1.01 and 1.02 contain an initial release of
	MOUSE.DRV. Beginning with Version 5.03 of the bus mouse, new InPort
	hardware was incorporated in the bus mouse design. An update to the
	MOUSE.DRV software is required for Windows to correctly recognize the
	mouse.
	
	The updated MOUSE.DRV is included in Windows Version 1.03 and later.
	In addition, it is included in the mouse Version 5.03 System disk and
	the current mouse Version 1.00 Setup disk.
	
	If you have Version 6.x of the mouse, you can obtain the updated
	MOUSE.DRV by calling Microsoft Product Support hardware group at (206)
	454-2030 and requesting for the "Mouse Drivers Update Disk."
	
	The above problem may also affect ISVs and OEMs that have developed
	stand-alone Windows applications or have licensed and adapted Windows
	using the initial Windows development software.
