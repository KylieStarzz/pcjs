	Article: Q63703
	Version(s): 2.51
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 11-JUL-1990
	
	Question:
	
	Why do I get a beep when I try to select a sample assembly program
	under QuickAssembler version 2.51?
	
	Response:
	
	For all sample programs that are not listed in uppercase, you must
	place your cursor on the filename and click the right mouse button. If
	a mouse is not available, use the TAB key to get the the topic and
	then press F1.
	
	Note: Programs listed in uppercase are programs that have their own
	help contexts. Therefore, they can be selected by clicking on the left
	mouse button, or by pressing ENTER after placing the cursor on the
	filename. Programs listed in lowercase are accessed via the hyperlink,
	meaning you MUST select the right mouse button.
