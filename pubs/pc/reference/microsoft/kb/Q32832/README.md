	   Version 5.10 of the Macro Assembler includes a new command-line
	option that shows all code generated by MASM.
	   The command-line option /LA displays the results of the simplified
	segment directives and code generated by the high-level language
	support features. The following is a sample source file with simplified
	segment directives and a fragment of the listing file created by using
	/LA:
	
	     .model small
	     .data
	     .code
	     end
	
	     .model small
	     assume cs:@code,ds:@data,ss:@data
	     .data
	     _DATA segment 'DATA'
	     .code
	     @CurSeg ends
	     _TEXT segment  'CODE'
	     end
	     @CurSeg ends
