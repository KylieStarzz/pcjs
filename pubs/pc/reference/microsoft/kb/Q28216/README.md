## Q28216: Cannot Backup Disk

	Article: Q28216
	Version(s): 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |

	Question:
	   I am trying to make backup copies of my distribution disks. One
	of the disks will not copy; the disk is labeled "Microsoft CodeView and
	Utilities for MS-OS/2." Is this disk corrupt?
	
	Response:
	   The disk should be fine. The information on this disk is required
	only by individuals who have MS-OS/2 and was intentionally saved on a
	high-density formatted disk.
	   Since OS/2 must be run on a 286 or 386 machine, reading this disk
	will not be a problem since these machines have high-density floppy
	drives.
	   If your machine is less than a 286, you probably have a low-density
	disk drive and you will not be able to read this disk; however, you
	will not be running under MS-OS/2 and will not need the information on
	the disk anyway.
