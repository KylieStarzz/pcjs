## Q43931: BC 6.00's BUILDRTM Has Not Been Tested with QB 4.50's Compiler

	Article: Q43931
	Version(s): 6.00 6.00b 7.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_QuickBas
	Last Modified: 4-JAN-1990
	
	QuickBASIC Version 4.50 has not been tested with the BUILDRTM.EXE
	found in Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b and
	Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00. Microsoft does not claim that
	BUILDRTM.EXE will work correctly with object modules compiled using
	the BC.EXE compiler from QuickBASIC 4.50.
	
	"Unresolved Externals" during linkage is one of the reported errors
	that occurs when using the BUILDRTM.EXE on an object module compiled
	with the BC.EXE from QuickBASIC 4.50.
	
	BUILDRTM is designed for use only with Microsoft BASIC Compiler
	Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and OS/2 and Microsoft BASIC PDS
	Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and OS/2. BUILDRTM adds routines to extend the
	BRUN6xx.EXE run-time libraries for Versions 6.00 and 6.00b and the
	BRT70xxx.EXE run-time libraries for BASIC PDS 7.00.
