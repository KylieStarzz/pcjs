	Although QuickC Version 2.00 includes a Presentation Graphics library,
	PGCHART.LIB, which offers the ability to generate presentation charts,
	there is no utility to print the graphics screen to a printer.
	
	There are third-party utilities that are specifically designed to
	capture graphics screens and save them in printable files.
	
	Microsoft is actively considering the addition of this abitliy
	in a future release of QuickC.
