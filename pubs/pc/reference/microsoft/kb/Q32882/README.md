## Q32882: Comment Strings Should Not Overlap Onto the Next Line

	Article: Q32882
	Version(s): 5.10   | 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr

	On Pages 22 and 23 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.1 Updates
	and Microsoft Editor" manual there is an example using various text
	macros called SaveRegs and RestRegs. In this example, there are
	comment strings that overlap onto the next line because of wrap
	around.
	   Please note that this is wrap around from the comment, and not a
	new instruction.
