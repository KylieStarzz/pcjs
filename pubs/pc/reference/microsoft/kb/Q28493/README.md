## Q28493: Restricted Mouse Cursor Movement in Pro Design II

	Article: Q28493
	Version(s): 1.0
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 21-APR-1988
	
	When using Pro Design II, the mouse cursor is restricted to a 1
	inch box in the top left-hand corner.
	
	   This problem has been reported with the mouse driver Version 6.02 through
	mouse driver Version 6.11. Currently the problem cannot be isolated to a
	mouse driver problem since the cursor movement restriction seems to occur
	only with the Pro Design II application.
	   Please contact American Small Business Computers, developers of Pro
	Design II, at (918) 825-4844. An update may resolve the problem.
	   Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
	as it becomes available.
