	SMARTDRV DOCUMENTATION
	----------------------
	
	Description
	-----------
	
	SMARTDRV.SYS is a disk-caching program for computers that have a hard
	disk and extended or expanded memory. For SMARTDRV to operate
	correctly, the current version of HIMEM must be installed.
	
	Usage
	-----
	
	   DEVICE=[d:][path]SMARTDRV.SYS [size][/a]
	
	<size> is the amount of memory you want SMARTDRV to have. The default
	is 256K of extended memory or all of expanded memory.
	
	The /a switch is used when you have expanded memory or an expanded
	memory emulator. If you omit this switch, SMARTDRV uses extended
	memory.
