## Q43258: strspn() Function Not Directly Available in On-line Help

	Article: Q43258
	Version(s): 2.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist2.00 docerr
	Last Modified: 2-MAY-1989
	
	The function strspn() cannot be found in the QuickC Advisor (on-line
	help for QuickC Version 2.00), even though it is listed in the index.
	
	The information for "strspn" can be found under "strcspn".
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 2.00. We are
	researching the problem and will post new information as it becomes
	available.
