	Question: What is Quick Assembler?
	
	Quick Assembler is, simply put, QuickC 2.00 with the addition of a
	Quick Assembler which is completely functional within the Quick
	environment. You can edit, assemble, and debug pure assembly programs
	with the benefit of Online Assembly Help. It also is designed to make
	mixed-language programming even easier and faster than before.
	
	This package has all the capabilities of QuickC 2.00 with the added
	performance enhancement of a full assembler.
	
	Quick Assembler does NOT replace the Inline Assembler. It is a full
	assembler which supports pure assembly source. The Inline Assembler is
	still available as a feature of QuickC.
	
	Quick Assembler is NOT a stand-alone package. It is bundled with
	specific QuickC 2.01 packages. There is a fulfillment package for
	owners of QuickC 2.00 which allows the upgrading to QuickC/Quick
	Assembler.
