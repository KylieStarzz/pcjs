## Q49892: Logitech Bus Mouse Can Use Microsoft Mouse Drivers

	Article: Q49892
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S890501-141 B_BasicCom H_Mouse H_DriverPR
	Last Modified: 18-OCT-1989
	
	Logitech bus mice can use all versions of the Microsoft Mouse driver
	earlier than Version 7.00. This does not apply to Logitech serial
	mice. Logitech serial mice must use the Logitech mouse driver.
	
	Versions of the Logitech mouse driver released before QuickBASIC
	Version 4.50 (before September 29, 1988) might not work correctly with
	QuickBASIC 4.50. To use the Logitech bus mouse, the Microsoft Mouse
	driver should be installed.
	
	Logitech technical support has confirmed that all of their bus mice
	have been tested with the Microsoft Mouse drivers up to, but not
	including, Version 7.00. Version 7.00 of the Microsoft Mouse driver is
	shipped with the new high-resolution 400 ppi (pixels per inch)
	Microsoft Mouse and has not been tested with the Logitech bus mice.
