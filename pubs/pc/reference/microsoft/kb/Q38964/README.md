## Q38964: QuickBASIC 4.50 Incompatible with Sperry 8086 PC with IBM CGA

	Article: Q38964
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S881128-21
	Last Modified: 12-JAN-1990
	
	It has been reported that a Sperry 8086 or 8088 PC upgraded with an
	IBM CGA card is incompatible with QuickBASIC Version 4.50. The same
	configuration reportedly works with QuickBASIC Versions 4.00 and
	4.00b.
	
	To correct this problem, turn the "Advanced Features" switch (switch
	number 3) on the back of the machine into the off (down) position.
	QuickBASIC 4.50 should then work correctly.
	
	Note: Turning off the "Advanced Features" switch may not correct the
	problem if you have a Hercules card on the Sperry PC. QuickBASIC 4.50
	has not been tested on a Sperry PC with an installed Hercules card,
	and therefore, you may experience QuickBASIC 4.50 compatibility
	problems.
