## Q38886: Leading Edge Display Problems with QuickBASIC Version 4.50

	Article: Q38886
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 23-APR-1990
	
	Microsoft has not tested QuickBASIC Version 4.50 with Leading Edge
	computers; therefore, we do not claim any compatibility between
	QuickBASIC Version 4.50 and Leading Edge. Running QuickBASIC Version
	4.50 on a Leading Edge computer might give you some display or editor
	problems.
	
	It has been reported that QuickBASIC works correctly with Leading Edge
	Model D with ROM BIOS Versions 3.00 or later (running MS-DOS 3.30),
	but may fail with earlier versions. Microsoft has not confirmed this
	information. Other unconfirmed reports are listed below.
	
	It has also been reported that when using a Leading Edge Model M, you
	are unable to get QuickBASIC Version 4.50 to appear on the screen
	successfully. The problem occurs with either a Leading Edge Hercules
	video card or a Leading Edge CGA video card. According to the report,
	earlier versions of QuickBASIC work correctly. According to one
	customer, the Leading Edge Model M (and Model MT) has a Switch 3 for
	Advanced Features (for color support and RS-232 enhancements). If
	Switch 3 is ON, the picture is bad using a CGA card and monochrome
	monitor, but with Switch 3 off, the screen looks fine.
	
	It has been reported that a Leading Edge Model D does not work
	correctly when used with either the Microsoft Mouse or the shortcut
	editing keys when cutting and pasting text in QuickBASIC Version 4.50.
	The first time an attempt is made to cut and paste text, the operation
	is successful. However, when a second attempt is made to cut and paste
	text, the operation is unsuccessful.
	
	It also has been reported that when TRACE is on in the QuickBASIC
	environment, the lines of text are not highlighted; only a cursor
	appears, moving from line to line. The Leading Edge's video card may
	be causing the problem.
	
	Two customers reported that SETUP.EXE would not work on the Leading
	Edge Model D, but they could run QuickBASIC and QB Express from the
	floppy disks.
	
	A customer with a Leading Edge Model D2 found a solution to his video
	problems using QuickBASIC. He said an ATI video file came with his
	computer, and he ran the program VCONFIG, which contains a menu that
	let him set video options. His computer was set to VGA, but he
	actually had an EGA, so he set it to EGA, and then QB.EXE worked
	correctly with no video problems.
	
	As stated above, this information has not been confirmed by Microsoft.
