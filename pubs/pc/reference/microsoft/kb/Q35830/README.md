## Q35830: No Support for Color Hercules Graphics Adapters in QuickBASIC

	Article: Q35830
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# G880920-3454 B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 12-DEC-1989
	
	The Hercules graphics driver in QuickBASIC only supports monochrome
	graphics (720 X 348 pixel resolution). Hercules color cards are not
	supported and have not been tested with QuickBASIC; therefore, the
	color cards may or may not work. For displaying color, QuickBASIC
	supports IBM CGA, EGA, and VGA graphic adapters.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b
	and 4.50, the version of QuickBASIC that comes with Microsoft BASIC
	Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and Microsoft
	BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
	
	Microsoft has received reports that QB.EXE will hang on a computer
	with a Hercules color card installed. However, Microsoft has not
	tested or verified this since QuickBASIC does not officially support
	Hercules color cards.
