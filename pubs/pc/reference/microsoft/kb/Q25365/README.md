	Operating System: MS-DOS

	Problem:
	
	If my COM file is less than 8 bytes long and I try to load it into
	CodeView, I get the error message "Invalid executable file format -
	please relink."
	
	Response:
	
	This problem occurs only on COM files less than 8 bytes in length.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with CodeView Version
	2.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information as
	it becomes available.
