	BB0354: BASIC PDS Question Reply Letter
	---------------------------------------
	
	Dear BASIC Professional Development System Customer:
	
	Thank you for your letter concerning the BASIC Professional
	Development System (PDS). Although we are unable to respond to your
	technical questions by letter, we do forward your letters to our BASIC
	PDS development team. This procedure provides developers with customer
	feedback, which will in turn make Microsoft's products even better.
	Now that we can no longer respond to letters (unless solicited by
	Microsoft), we are providing the following new service:
	
	Our toll-line number, (206) 637-7096, is available Monday through
	Friday (except holidays), 8 AM to 5 PM Pacific Standard Time, and is
	designed to answer questions about set up and installation procedures,
	problem reports, and documentation errors. We also address most
	programming, code debugging, and problem solving issues.
	
	We are also offering a 900-number service to provide a higher quality
	of service, extended hours, and a shorter waiting time. To access
	"OnCall(TM) for BASIC," call (900) 896-9999. The cost is $2 per
	minute, and the service is available Monday through Friday from 6 AM
	to 6 PM Pacific Standard Time. To obtain the best possible service, we
	recommend you be at your computer and have your BASIC Professional
	Development System reference manuals and disks handy when you call.
	
	There are many supplemental sources of information relating to the
	BASIC languages, including reference guides and books published by
	Microsoft Press, or you can contact our "OnCall for BASIC" service at
	(900) 896-9999. Support is also available electronically through
	Microsoft OnLine and CompuServe. One of the features of these services
	is to provide access to the Microsoft Knowledge Base. The Microsoft
	Knowledge Base contains the latest technical information about
	Microsoft language products. For more information about Microsoft
	OnLine, which is designed for software developers, call (800)
	443-4672. For more information about CompuServe, which is the largest
	general online information service for personal computer users, call
