## Q58819: Microsoft Editor Cannot Use QuickBASIC Extended Help Files

	Article: Q58819
	Version(s): 7.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S900209-75 s_editor S_PWB
	Last Modified: 6-SEP-1990
	
	Microsoft Editor (M.EXE and MEP.EXE) version 1.20, which is included
	with Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) version
	7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, cannot use the QuickBASIC Extended
	(QBX.EXE) Microsoft Advisor online Help system files. (The QBX.EXE
	editor environment is also included with BASIC PDS 7.00.)
	
	The online Help files used by QBX.EXE are of the wrong size and format
	to be used by the M.EXE or MEP.EXE editor.
	
	No version of the M.EXE or MEP.EXE editor can use the Microsoft
	Advisor online Help files used by QBX.EXE.
	
	This problem is eliminated by using PWB (Programmer's WorkBench),
	which comes with Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.10. PWB.EXE replaces the
	M.EXE/MEP.EXE editor, and improves functionality.
	
	The help files of QBX.EXE and PWB.EXE can be created and modified
	using HELPMAKE.EXE, the Microsoft Help File Creation Utility.
