	The Leading Edge 386 SX computer has what appears to be a PS/2-style
	mouse port near the keyboard connector. This is actually an inport
	mouse connector designed for a Microsoft-compatible bus mouse,
	according to Page 6-13 of the "Leading Edge 386 SX User's Guide." The
	connection is a standard hosedin connector for an inport mouse.
	
	There is one switch that may or may not be in the correct position to
	install the mouse. This is Switch 3 on the motherboard. This must be
	in the ON position or the mouse will not install.
