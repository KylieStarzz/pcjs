## Q42593: Problem Using the Edit Keys on Zenith 184 Supersport Laptop

	Article: Q42593
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S890224-117
	Last Modified: 21-MAR-1989
	
	Microsoft has not tested QuickBASIC Version 4.50 with the Zenith 184
	Supersport laptop computer. We do not claim compatibility between
	QuickBASIC 4.50 and the Supersport, and there may be some hardware
	incompatibility problems.
	
	For example, it has been reported that the edit keys (SHIFT+DEL,
	SHIFT+INS, and CTRL+INS) do not perform correctly on the Supersport.
	The workaround for this problem is to use the QuickBASIC Edit menu
	choices (Cut, Paste, and Copy), which can be accessed with the ALT
	key.
	
	Microsoft has not confirmed this information.
