	Problem:
	
	I have just clicked my right mouse button to acknowledge a pop-up
	message and my mouse cursor has disappeared. I had just clicked my
	right mouse button before for another operation.
	
	Note: This also occurs when you hit any button on the three button
	Logitech mouse.
	
	Response:
	
	To get your mouse cursor back again, redraw the screen with the "@"
	command.
