## Q37423: QuickBASIC Support Hours, Press Release October 1990

	Article: Q37423
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr
	Last Modified: 21-FEB-1991
	
	The QB Advisor online Help system provided with the first packaging of
	Microsoft QuickBASIC version 4.50 incorrectly lists the telephone
	number and service hours for Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS)
	for QuickBASIC.
	
	Microsoft introduced a repackaged version of QuickBASIC 4.50 in
	September 1990, and the telephone number and the support hours
	changed. This is explained in a press release in a separate article,
	which can be found with the following query:
	
	   OnCall and BASIC and expanded and support
	
	(On October 23, 1990, Microsoft announced OnCall(TM) for BASIC and
	expanded technical support for Microsoft QuickBASIC users.)
	
	Information on PSS has been deleted from the online Help system in the
	repackaged QuickBASIC 4.50. However, the Languages/Hardware support
	phone number, (206) 637-7096, is still incorrectly listed on the
	"Product Assistance Request Form" in the back of the repackaged
	QuickBASIC manual.
	
	Instead, QuickBASIC customers should call (206) 646-5101, from 8:00 AM
	to 5:00 PM Monday through Friday (excluding holidays), for entry-level
	assistance.
	
	For advanced programming questions and support of noncurrent versions,
	QuickBASIC customers may call (900) 896-9999 at a cost of $2.00 per
	minute, from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM PST Monday through Friday (excluding
	holidays). Hold time will be minimal on the 900 phone number. If your
	phone system is blocked from calling 900 numbers, you may call our
	unblocking toll number, (206) 646-5102, for a credit card charge of
	$20.00 per call.
