## Q21331: MS-DOS BASIC Compiler Does Not Provide ISAM File Support

	Article: Q21331
	Version(s): 5.35 5.36 6.00 6.00b 7.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 2-FEB-1990
	
	Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 5.35, 5.36, 6.00, and 6.00b for
	MS-DOS does not support Index Sequential Files (ISAM). You must write
	your own routine or use a third-party vendor's routine that is
	compatible with the BASIC compiler.
	
	Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for
	MS-DOS does support ISAM files. BASIC PDS 7.00 currently supports
	single-user ISAM, however.
