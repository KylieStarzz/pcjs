	Question:
	
	What is the definitive Microsoft reference that describes "the rules"
	for creating a TSR?
	
	Response:
	
	Since the DOS environment is so loosely structured, there are no hard
	and fast rules that guarantee that a TSR will work correctly with any
	application. The best source for this information is the "MS-DOS
	Encyclopedia" (published by Microsoft Press). This excellent reference
	contains a 37-page chapter on TSRs, and other related information on
	exception handlers and hardware-interrupt service routines. If you
	take care to write your TSR in the manner described in this reference,
	you will minimize interactions and other problems.
