	The agreement allows you to distribute your programs on a royalty-free
	basis.
	
	You can read this agreement on the back of the "break-the-seal" disk
	envelope (paragraph number 2) for the compiler. The agreement reads as
	follows:
	
	   DISTRIBUTION OF RUNTIME MODULES: Microsoft grants to you a
	   royalty-free right to reproduce and distribute the runtime modules
	   of the COMPILER provided that you: (a) distribute the runtime
	   modules only in conjunction with and as a part of your own software
	   product; (b) do not use Microsoft's name, logo, or trademarks to
	   market your software product; (c) include Microsoft's copyright
	   notice for the COMPILER on your product label and as part of the
	   sign-on message for your software product; and (d) otherwise comply
	   with this Agreement. The "run-time modules" are those files in the
	   COMPILER that are identified in the documentation as required
	   during execution of your compiled program. The runtime modules are
	   limited to runtime files, install files, and ISAM and REBUILD
	   files.
	
	If you are interested in receiving a complete copy of the latest
	run-time license agreement, contact the Microsoft Information Center
	by calling (800) 426-9400 or (206) 882-8088.
