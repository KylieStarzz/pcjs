## Q67847: C 6.00a CD-ROM Setup Does Not Install RAMDRIVE or SMARTDRV

	Article: Q67847
	Version(s): 6.00a  | 6.00a
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist6.00a
	Last Modified: 31-JAN-1991
	
	When Setup is run from the CD-ROM version of Microsoft C version
	6.00a, the following two files are not found along the specified path:
	
	   \HD525\DISK7\RAMDRIVE.SYS
	   \HD525\DISK7\SMARTDRV.SYS
	
	The two files are included in this path:
	
	   \HD525\DISK6\RAMDRIVE.SYS
	   \HD525\DISK6\SMARTDRV.SYS
	
	Since the files are not compressed, they can be copied to your hard
	drive.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the C version 6.00a
	CD-ROM Setup program. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here as it becomes available.
