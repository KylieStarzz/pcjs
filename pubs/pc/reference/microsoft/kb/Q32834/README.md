	The line-continuation character (\) has been added to the
	Microsoft Macro Assembler. A program line can now extend over
	more than one physical line.
	   The backslash must be the last character in the line. Using the
	line-continuation character, you may have program lines up to 512
	characters. Physical lines are still limited to 128 characters.
