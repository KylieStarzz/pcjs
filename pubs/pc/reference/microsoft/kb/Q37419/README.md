	Microsoft doesn't offer a QuickBASIC (or BASIC) to C language
	translation program, but the following information describes one such
	program:
	
	   Software Translations has released B-Tran, a QuickBASIC-to-C source
	   code translator. This product is marketed in Europe by Sector 7
	   Software Ltd.
	
	   The current version, B-Tran Version 7, supports QuickBASIC Version
	   4.00. However, it does not support user-defined TYPEs or the
	   following new ways to dimension arrays introduced in QuickBASIC
	   Version 4.00:
	
	      DIM varname AS type
	      DIM arrayname (1 TO 5)
	
	   Software Translations lists this program for about $495. B-Tran
	   Version 7 produces C code from source code applications written in
	   Microsoft QuickBASIC. B-Tran is guaranteed by Software Translations
	   to have 97 percent translation. A demonstration disk is available
	   from Software Translations for $25.
