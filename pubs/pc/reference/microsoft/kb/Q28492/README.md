	Microsoft PS/2 serial mice are not guaranteed to work correctly
	with laptops due to the low power specification on serial ports
	usually found on the laptops.
	
	   PS/2 serial mice with the SSMA adapters (cigarette box shaped
	adapters) may not work properly with the Zenith laptop models 181 and
	183.
	   The current mice with the UMA adapters (cigar-shaped adapters) with
	the Version 6.14 mouse driver have been tested informally and seem to
	work properly with the Zenith laptops.
