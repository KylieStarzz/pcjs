## Q41249: QuickC 2.00 README.DOC: ESC Key Does Not Stop Linker

	The information below is from "Part 1: Notes on 'Up and Running'" of
	the QuickC Version 2.00 README.DOC file.
	
	The following notes refer to specific pages in the QuickC Version 2.00
	"Up and Running" manual:
	
	A Brief Guide to the Keystrokes
	
	The chart on the inside front cover says that the ESC key "stops the
	compiler and linker from continuing." ESC stops the compiler but NOT
	the linker. Press CTRL+BREAK to stop both the compiler and the linker.
	
	If you are using the debugger and running a program that expects
	keyboard input, pressing either CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK and then ENTER
	allows you to exit.
