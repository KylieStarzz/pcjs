## Q64027: Adding Dependencies to QuickC 2.50 Make File Disrupts QuickC

	Article: Q64027
	Version(s): 2.50 2.51
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist2.51 s_quickasm
	Last Modified: 31-AUG-1990
	
	Adding dependencies directly to a Microsoft QuickC version
	2.50-generated make file can cause unpredictable results when
	rebuilding from within the environment. The results observed so far
	include the following:
	
	1. The machine hangs.
	
	2. A Fatal Internal Error is produced.
	
	3. The error u1073 -- "don't know how to make Learn QuickC" occurs.
	
	The problems mentioned above are unpredictable but stem from the same
	cause. The make files generated by Microsoft QuickC are intended to be
	modified solely through the use of certain editor menus, that is, the
	make/edit program list. When direct changes are made to these make
	files, any subsequent use of them by QuickC will meet with
	unpredictable results.
	
	If you want to make changes to a make file created by QuickC and still
	use the integrated environment for building your program, you must do
	so through the menu system. The other alternative is to make the
	changes to the make file and then rebuild from the command line with
	the NMAKE utility.
