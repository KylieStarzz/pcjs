## Q40586: Display Command Returns Incorrect Result for FORTRAN Function

	Article: Q40586
	Version(s): 2.20 2.30 | 2.20 2.30
	Operating System: MS-DOS    | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist2.20 buglist2.30
	Last Modified: 14-AUG-1989
	
	The display command does not return correct values for the
	user-defined FORTRAN real functions in Microsoft CodeView.
	
	The display command calls integer functions and returns correct
	results.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 2.20. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information as it becomes
	available.
	
	The display command is discussed in Chapter 6 of the "Microsoft
	CodeView and Utilities" manual. The valid FORTRAN expressions for
	CodeView are discussed in the Chapter 4 of the same manual.
