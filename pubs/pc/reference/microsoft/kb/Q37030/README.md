## Q37030: BASIC Memory Model: Determining Segment Sizes with LINK /MAP

	Article: Q37030
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# G881013-4601 B_BasicCom

	QuickBASIC uses a medium memory model plus dynamic and huge (larger
	than 64K) dynamic arrays supported in far heap. With this model, a
	program may contain multiple code segments (up to 64K per module) and
	one 64K shared data segment (known as DGROUP). The space that is not
	used by the code and DGROUP at run time is left for allocation of
	dynamic and huge dynamic arrays.
	
	The LINK .MAP file can be used to determine the size of the code
	segment(s) and the static portion of the DGROUP segment, as shown
	below. However, the FRE function is easier to use than the LINK .MAP
	file for getting information about data allocation.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b
	and 4.50 for MS-DOS, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and
	6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and to Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00 for
	MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
	
	Note that allocating longer variable-length strings consumes more
	DGROUP space at run time than is indicated by the initial, static
	DGROUP allocation shown in the LINK .MAP file.
	
	Rather than using the LINK .MAP file, a better method to determine
	data usage is to invoke the FRE function within a program at run time.
	FRE("") returns the amount of dynamic space free for strings and
	dynamic arrays in DGROUP. FRE(-1) returns the amount of space free for
	dynamic arrays in far heap.
	
	To generate a link map, use the /MAP switch for the linker (LINK
	/MAP). The following link map is generated by linking a module called
	DOG.OBJ and is explained further below:

	In the above example, a source module called DOG.BAS was compiled and
	linked, resulting in a code segment name of DOG_CODE, which is limited
	to a maximum of 64K in size (if other compiler limitations are not
	exceeded first). DOG_CODE has the class name of BC_CODE. If your code
	module is approaching 64K in size, you should break it into SUBprogram
	and/or FUNCTION procedures in separate modules that can be compiled
	separately and then linked with the main module.
	
	The first three lines in the above map are the code segments. Each
	segment named can be up to 64K in size. Their classes are usually
	BC_CODE, CODE, and ENDCODE.
	
	The Origin section at the bottom of the link map tells you the
	position where the default data segment (DGROUP) starts, relative to
	the start of the .EXE code. The sum of the length of the items in
	DGROUP cannot exceed 64K. Items in DGROUP start at 008D:0 in the above
	map [which means offset 0 from the (16-byte) paragraph address 008D
	hex].
	
	For other programs, you may find another group, FMGROUP, whose origin
	is listed at the bottom of the link map (not shown in the above
	example). This group is used when you compile with the /AH option.
	FMGROUP is used for allocation tables and messages relating to far
	data. Arrays in far heap are not allocated space until run time.
	
	Note that the addresses given in the link map are not absolute load
	addresses -- instead, they are relative to the start of the code in
	the relocatable .EXE file. Only at run time does MS-DOS decide the
	absolute address where the .EXE program is loaded in memory. The
	VARPTR and VARSEG statements can then be used within a BASIC program
	to determine absolute addresses of variables and arrays at run time.
	Debuggers such as Microsoft CodeView, provided with the BASIC compiler
	Versions 6.00 and 6.00b, may also be used to determine absolute load
	locations at run time.
