## Q68367: PWB Build Switch Reference Available as an Application Note

	Article: Q68367

	The "PWB Build Switch Reference" contains detailed descriptions and
	examples for customizing PWB build switches.
	
	The Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) can build various types of projects
	based on the information contained in "build switches." These build
	switches are interpreted by PWB in order to create a makefile for a
	project. The switches are normally set for you by PWB for common types
	of projects, but you may define your own build switches to handle an
	advanced project where you require more control over the build
	process. For example, customized build switches will allow you to
	utilize different languages, to incorporate other tools into a
	project, or to build new kinds of targets.
	
	Although build switch customization is documented in the PWB online
	help, the information is somewhat limited. Therefore, an application
	note was created to cover the customization process in detail. The
	title of this application note is "PWB Build Switch Reference" and it
	can be obtained by calling Microsoft Product Support Services at (206)
	637-7096.
	
	The "PWB Build Switch Reference" can also be found in the Software/
	Data Library (as file SW0330.ARC) by searching on the keyword SW0330,
	the Q number of this article, or S12875. SW0330 was archived using the
	PKware file-compression utility.
	
	Note that the application note found in the Software/Data Library is
	an ordinary text file, which lacks the typefaces and formatting of the
	printed version that is available by calling Microsoft Product Support
	Services. Because the printed application note is clearer and easier
	to follow, it is highly recommended that you call for the printed
	version, and that you use the downloaded version only as an interim
	copy.
	
	Also note that you normally DO NOT need to modify build switches just
	to customize the compile and link operations -- this can generally be
	done by selecting commands from the Options menu. By selecting options
	from the Compile or LINK Options dialog boxes, the correct build
	switches are automatically modified to contain the desired
	information.
