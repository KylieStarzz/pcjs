	Error code 2, "Syntax Error," needs to be added to the "Run-Time Error
	Codes" in Table D.1 on Page 476 of the following manuals:
	
	1. "Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.00: BASIC Language Reference"
	
	2. "Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version 6.00 for MS-DOS and OS/2: BASIC
	   Language Reference"
	
	D.1 "Run-Time Error Codes" lists errors in numerical order. The
	section following this table lists errors alphabetically and explains
	the conditions under which each error may occur.
	
	The following explanation for error code 2, "Syntax Error," is taken
	from Page 502:
	
	   "Several conditions can cause this error. The most common cause at
	    compile time is a mistyped BASIC keyword or argument. At run-time,
	    it is often caused by an improperly formatted DATA statement."
