## Q41366: QuickC 2.00 README.DOC: Installing on a Floppy-Disk System

	Article: Q41366
	Version(s): 2.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr
	Last Modified: 28-FEB-1989
	
	The following information is taken from the QuickC 2.00 README.DOC
	file, Part 1, "Notes on 'Up and Running.'" The following notes refer
	to Page 15 in "Up and Running": Installing on a Floppy-Disk System.
	
	Note: This information applies only to those using dual floppy
	systems.
	
	The description of the first screen says you are asked if you want to
	include PGCHART.LIB in the combined libraries. This is incorrect.
	There isn't enough room on the scratch disk for PGCHART.LIB and all of
	the other component libraries. If you want to use presentation
	graphics, you have two choices. You can link PGCHART.LIB separately,
	using the Make menu Edit Program List command, or you can use the LIB
	program to add PGCHART to the combined library after you finish
	installing QuickC.
