## Q33137: Linker Module-Definition Files for MS OS/2 or Windows

	Article: Q33137
	Version(s): 6.00 6.00b 7.00 | 6.00 6.00b 7.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS          | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER |

	A module-definition file, used by LINK.EXE, describes the name,
	attributes, exports, imports, and other characteristics of an
	application or library for MS OS/2 (or Microsoft Windows). This file
	is required for dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that run under MS OS/2
	(and for Microsoft Windows applications and libraries).
	
	Note that Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b and
	Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00
	cannot make Microsoft Windows applications or libraries. These
	products can only make OS/2 applications.
	
	For more information about the module-definition file used by LINK,
	see Page Update 39 in the "Microsoft CodeView and Utilities: Software
	Development Tools for MS OS/2 and MS-DOS: Update" manual.
	
	For more information about BASIC compatibility with Microsoft Windows,
	search for a separate article with the following words:
	
	   Windows and SDK and BASIC and compiler
