## Q34360: Documentation Error Regarding Precedence Operators

	Article: Q34360
	Version(s): 5.00 5.10 | 5.10

	There is a documentation error regarding C Version 5.00 and Version
	5.10 operator precedence. Table 5.1 on Page 137 of the "Microsoft C
	Language Reference Manual" shows two curly braces. Both of these curly
	braces are over-extended in printing.
	   The curly brace at the top should only extend from the second line
	to the third line; the curly brace at the bottom should start at the
	fourth-to-last line and stop at the second-to-last line.
