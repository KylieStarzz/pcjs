## Q58660: TIMEVALUE# Function Documentation Correction in BASIC 7.00

	Article: Q58660
	Version(s): 7.00 7.10 | 7.00 7.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS    | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S900208-180 docerr
	Last Modified: 8-JAN-1991
	
	The following reference to the TIMEVALUE# function on Page 486 of the
	"Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Language Reference" manual (for 7.00 and 7.10)
	is incorrect. The second sentence in the remarks section states the
	following:
	
	   Time can be entered as "2:24PM" or "14:24".
	
	This sentence should indicate a space between "2:24" and "PM" and read
	as follows:
	
	   Time can be entered as "2:24 PM" or "14:24".
	
	The TIMEVALUE function is a routine in the "add-on library" included
	with Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System versions 7.00 and
	7.10 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
