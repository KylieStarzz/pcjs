## Q39866: Quick Library Routines Must Be Compiled in Same Version as QB

	Article: Q39866
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# G881214-8094 B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 12-DEC-1989
	
	Compiled BASIC modules that are placed into a Quick library must be
	compiled with the same version of BC.EXE that was shipped with the
	QB.EXE in use.
	
	For example, BASIC code placed into a Quick library that will be used
	with QuickBASIC Version 4.50 must be compiled with the BC.EXE shipped
	with Version 4.50. Prior versions of BC.EXE, such as the version
	shipped with Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 or 6.00b, are not
	necessarily compatible with QuickBASIC Version 4.50.
	
	This information applies to the QB.EXE environment of QuickBASIC
	Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, to the QB.EXE environment of
	Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b, and to the QBX.EXE
	environment of the Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00.
