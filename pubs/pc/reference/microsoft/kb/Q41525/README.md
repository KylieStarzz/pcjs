	The BC.EXE command-line options are not included in the QB Advisor
	on-line help that comes with Version 4.50. They are discussed in the
	following manuals:
	
	1. Pages 353 and 354 of the "Microsoft QuickBASIC: Programming in
	   BASIC" manual for Version 4.50
	
	2. Pages 210 and 211 of the "Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.0: Learning and
	   Using Microsoft QuickBASIC" manual for Versions 4.00 and 4.00b
	
	The command-line options for BC are identical in QuickBASIC Versions
	4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50. When you update to Version 4.50 from 4.00 or
	4.00b, you can refer to the Version 4.00 or 4.00b manual for the BC
	options list.
	
	The BC /T (Terse) option is used in both Version 4.00b and 4.50. More
	information on this switch can be found in this database by querying
	for the following keywords:
	
	   TERSE and BC and OPTION
