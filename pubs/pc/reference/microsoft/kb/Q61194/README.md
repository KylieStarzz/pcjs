	CL and LINK Environment Variables Work As Before
	------------------------------------------------
	
	The CL and LINK environment variables work just as in previous
	versions of Microsoft C. The contents of the environment variable are
	interpreted as a series of command-line options for the associated
	utility. Note, however, that the use of these environment variables
	can cause unpredictable build behavior under the Programmer's
	WorkBench (PWB).
