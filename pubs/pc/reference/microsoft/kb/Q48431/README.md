## Q48431: Macros ceil and floor Incorrectly Listed As Functions

	Article: Q48431
	Version(s): 5.00 5.10 | 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS    | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr
	Last Modified: 16-JAN-1990
	
	Page 94, Section 3.3.13 of the "Microsoft C 5.1 Optimizing Compiler
	User's Guide" incorrectly lists ceil and floor as functions that have
	intrinsic forms.
	
	As correctly noted in the "Microsoft C 5.1 Optimizing Compiler
	Run-Time Library Reference" on Pages 152 and 270, ceil and floor are
	macros defined in the include file MATH.H.
