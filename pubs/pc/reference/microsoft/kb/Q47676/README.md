	Tempest versions of the Microsoft Mouse are available from Quality
	Tempest Products (QTP) of Herndon, Va.
	
	A Tempest "approved" mouse is one that has been modified so that there
	are no RF emissions. This modification is needed so the mouse can be
	used in sensitive or classified areas
	
	For more information, contact Steve Rice of QTP at (703) 834-5200.
