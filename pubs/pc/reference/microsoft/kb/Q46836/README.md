	The following questions and answers concern the use of Glockenspiel
	C++:
	
	Q. Does Microsoft recommend the Glockenspiel C++ and CommonView?
	
	A. Microsoft has included their advertising literature in our C
	Version 5.10 package and has mentioned them in the new languages
	newsletter, which was sent to all registered users. Glockenspiel's C++
	is a preprocessor, which generates C 5.10 code from your C++ source
	program. (You then use Microsoft C 5.10 to compile this code.) This
	C++ product is currently the only way to use C++ while retaining the
	sophisticated code generation and tool set of Microsoft C. It is ideal
	for Microsoft customers who want to use C++ today.
	
	CommonView is a C++ object library, which makes programming for
	graphical user interfaces, including Windows, easier. This is also the
	only product of its type on the market today that is compatible with
	Microsoft C.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
	products' performance or reliability.
	
	Q. What does Microsoft think about C++? Does Microsoft recommend
	programming in C++?
	
	A. Microsoft has publicly stated that object-oriented programming,
	including C++, is the way of the future and that it will result in
	great productivity gains for programmers. We have already introduced
	object-oriented extensions in our new QuickPascal product and have
	announced that we are working on an implementation of C++ (release
	date is unknown). We think that this is very important technology and
	that it will make possible the sophisticated systems of tomorrow.
	
	Since C++ is going to be so important in the near future, it is
	certainly wise to start getting experience in it now.
	
	Q. Does Microsoft use C++ in-house?
	
	A. Microsoft uses a variety of languages in-house including Microsoft C
	and MASM. Beyond that, it is not possible to comment on which products
	use what languages.
