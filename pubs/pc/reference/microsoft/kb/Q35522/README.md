	The Difference between M and MEP?
	
	M.EXE is the Microsoft Editor that runs under DOS or MS OS/2 real
	mode. MEP.EXE runs under MS OS/2 protected mode only. You may want to
	rename MEP.EXE to M.EXE. Functionally, the two editors are the same,
	except for slight differences in background compilation.
