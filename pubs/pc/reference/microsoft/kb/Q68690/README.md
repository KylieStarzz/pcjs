	Article: Q68690
	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 6.00 6.00a | 6.00 6.00a
	Operating System: MS-DOS     | OS/2

	When a function is declared to take arguments but the function does
	not declare formal parameters, no warning is generated if the function
	is not called. The following code, when compiled with the /W4 switch,
	demonstrates this problem.
	
	Sample Code
	-----------
	
	void empty( int bar );
	
	void empty( void ){}
	
	void main( void ){}
	
	While Microsoft C versions 6.00 and 6.00a produce no errors in the
	above code, version 5.10 produces the following error:
	
	   void.c(3) : warning C4026 : function was declared with formal
	                               argument list
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the C compiler
	versions 6.00 and 6.00a. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here as it becomes available.
