	The Greenleaf Comm Library, a collection of asynchronous
	communications functions for use with the C compiler, causes severe
	complications with CodeView (e.g. crashes, lockups) due to interrupt
	conflicts. Greenleaf Software is aware of this difficulty and will
	advise customers of the incompatibility.
	
	No workarounds are available. Greenleaf Software is located in
	Carrollton, TX, and can be reached at (214) 248-2561.
