	The Link Utility generates the error message L1087: "unexpected
	end-of-file on scratch file" when a disk with the temporary linker
	output file has been removed. This information is documented in the
	"Microsoft Macro Assembler CodeView and Utilities Guide."
	
	The error message L1087 also can be caused by insufficient memory
	available on the disk that contains the temporary linker output file.
	The disk can be a hard disk, floppy disk, or RAM disk.
