	PWB Starts on Boot Monitor Under OS/2 1.10
	------------------------------------------
	
	In OS/2 1.10, starting up PWB on a dual-monitor system will result in
	PWB appearing on the monitor that was active at the time the system
	was booted.
	
	For example, suppose you have both a color and a monochrome monitor,
	and the color monitor is the active monitor when you boot your
	machine. If you switch to the monochrome monitor and then invoke PWB,
	PWB will appear on the color monitor.
	
	This problem does not exist under OS/2 1.20.
