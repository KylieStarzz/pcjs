## Q43529: COBOL LINK.EXE 5.02.05 Causes BASIC Program to Hang

	Article: Q43529
	Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S890411-6 B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 14-DEC-1989
	
	A program compiled with Microsoft QuickBASIC Version 4.00, 4.00b, or
	4.50, with Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version 6.00 or 6.00b, or with
	Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 hangs if it is linked with LINK.EXE
	Version 5.02.05 using /E for EXEPACK. This version of LINK.EXE is
	bundled with Microsoft COBOL Versions 3.00 and 3.00a and is not meant
	to be used with products other than Microsoft COBOL.
	
	In general, we recommend that the linker provided with a product be
	used with that product. The linkers provided with QuickBASIC and with
	the BASIC compiler work correctly with those products. The linker
	provided is tested with the product during its development and may
	also contain features or options that are specific to that product.
