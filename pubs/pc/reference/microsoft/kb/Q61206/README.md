	  build options.
	
	- Use the Compiler Options and Link Options commands to adjust
	  specific parameters.
	
	- If you are building a multimodule program, use Set Program List on
	  the Make menu to specify the files that will be included in the
	  program.
	
	- Choose Build or Rebuild All from the Make menu to build your
	  program.
