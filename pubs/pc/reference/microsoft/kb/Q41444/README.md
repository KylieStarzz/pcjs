	Closing a window with the close button does NOT clear its contents.
	For example, if you load a file into the Notepad window, close the
	window and then try to load the same file into the Source window,
	(either explicitly, or by pressing F2), QuickC will give you the
	error "File Already Loaded". To clear the contents of the Notepad
	window, you must choose the File menu New command while the Notepad
	window is active.
