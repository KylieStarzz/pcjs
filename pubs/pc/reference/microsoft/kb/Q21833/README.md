	Question:
	
	Why is an .EXE file compiled in QuickBASIC larger than an .EXE file
	compiled in the IBM Version 1.0 BASIC Compiler or the generic
	Microsoft MS-DOS BASIC Compiler Version 5.36?
	
	Response:
	
	QuickBASIC .EXE programs are larger because of added features and
	functionality. A program compiled with QuickBASIC will usually be
	larger than one compiled with older compilers.
