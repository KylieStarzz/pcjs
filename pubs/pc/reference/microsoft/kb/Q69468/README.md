	The following open letter describes Microsoft's telephone support
	policies for Microsoft BASIC and QuickBASIC, as of February 20, 1991:
	
	Dear Microsoft BASIC or QuickBASIC Customer:
	
	On October 23, 1990, Microsoft announced Microsoft OnCall(TM) for
	Microsoft BASIC. OnCall for BASIC offers high-level support, extended
	service hours, and minimal hold time for all Microsoft BASIC products
	through a 900 phone number or a flat rate added to a toll number.
	Microsoft offers OnCall for BASIC in response to customer demand for
	faster, more sophisticated support.
	
	"The entry-level support line meets the requirements of most customers
	who need assistance with installing Microsoft QuickBASIC software and
	getting up to speed. Those who require priority support on more
	advanced issues now have an additional option with Microsoft OnCall
	for BASIC," said Charles Stevens, general manager of Microsoft's Data
	Access Business Unit. Common questions from Microsoft OnCall for BASIC
	customers include inquiries about Microsoft QuickBASIC memory
	management, inter-language calling, and error and event trapping.
	
	Microsoft OnCall for BASIC is offered through a 900 phone number at a
	cost of $2.00 per minute. Hold time will be minimal and customers will
	not be charged until they reach a technician. Extended service hours
	are from 6 AM to 6 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST), Monday through
	Friday (excluding holidays). The Microsoft OnCall for BASIC phone
	number is (900) 896-9999.
	
	In many businesses, universities, and government agencies, the phone
	systems are blocked from using our 900 phone number. Therefore, you
	may also access OnCall for BASIC through the following unblocking toll
	number: (206) 646-5102, which is open 6 AM to 6 PM PST, Monday through
	Friday (excluding holidays), with a flat-rate fee of $20.00 per call
	for programming assistance. Only Master Card, VISA, and American
	Express credit cards are accepted.
	
	The entry-level phone line for Microsoft QuickBASIC supports Microsoft
	QuickBASIC version 4.50 for DOS systems, and Microsoft QuickBASIC
	version 1.00 for Macintosh(R) systems. Technicians will help new
	Microsoft QuickBASIC users get up and running as quickly as possible.
	The entry-level Microsoft QuickBASIC support number is (206) 646-5101.
	Service hours are 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM PST, Monday through Friday
	(excluding holidays).
	
	Users of Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System and earlier
	versions of the Microsoft BASIC compiler will continue to have
	unlimited support on the Microsoft Product Support Services toll line,
	which is (206) 637-7096 for Languages and Hardware. Support for all
	Microsoft BASIC products will continue on CompuServe as well.
