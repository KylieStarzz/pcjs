	It is not possible to directly resize windows in the Microsoft Editor.
	A window can only be opened or closed. To resize a window, it must be
	closed and then reopened. Direct resizing of windows is not currently
	possible.
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a
	future release.
