## Q38310: Moving to the Beginning of the Line with Microsoft Editor

	Article: Q38310
	Version(s): 1.00   | 1.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER |

	Question:
	
	Is there a way to go to column 1 of the screen with a key sequence
	instead of pressing the LEFT ARROW key until the cursor stops at
	column 1? I find myself wasting a lot of time doing this repetitive
	chore. The HOME key only takes me to the beginning of the text on the
	line, not the beginning of the line, which is where I want to be if I
	want to delete a line, for example. I currently use ^K-S with the
	Wordstar extension.
	
	Response:
	
	Meta Begline (F9 HOME in the standard configuration) will do it. If
	you'd like it on one key, you can assign the functions to a key using
	the macro facility.
