## Q32129: Earlier Versions of Generic Cad May Not Work with InPort

	Article: Q32129
	Version(s): 1.00 5.03 6.00 6.02 6.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 8-AUG-1988
	
	Generic Cad recommends Interrupt 3 for the J4 setting of the bus
	mouse.
	   Be aware that older versions (possibly releases 1 and 2) of Generic
	Cad may not work correctly with versions of the bus mice that include
	the InPort Interface. Because Generic Cad goes directly to the
	hardware (i.e., it uses its own mouse driver), you must obtain an
	update to release 1 or 2. To obtain an update, contact Generic Cad by
	calling (206) 487-2934.
