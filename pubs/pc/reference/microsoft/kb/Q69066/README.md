	Product: Microsoft C

	In QuickC, if you choose Display from the Options menu, there are two
	options for "Prompt Before Save" and "Save Before Build." If you are
	using a program list containing more than two files, you will always
	be prompted to save the modified file regardless of how the "Save
	Before Build" option is set.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickC versions
	2.50 and 2.51. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here as it becomes available.
