## Q37416: QuickBASIC Hasn't Been Tested with PC-MOS or Concurrent DOS

	Article: Q37416
	Version(s): 1.00 1.01 1.02 2.00 2.01 3.00 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_BasicCom

	PC-MOS and Concurrent DOS are operating systems (not developed by
	Microsoft) that allow multitasking. QuickBASIC has not been tested
	with PC-MOS or Concurrent DOS.
	
	Customers running the QuickBASIC environment (QB.EXE or QBX.EXE) or
	running programs created with QuickBASIC or compiled BASIC on PC-MOS
	or Concurrent DOS have reported a variety of problems, including
	failures to recognize keyboard input. Microsoft is not responsible for
	any third-party compatibility claims regarding use of the PC-MOS or
	Concurrent DOS operating system with any version of QuickBASIC (1.00,
	1.01, 1.02, 2.00, 2.01, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, or 4.50) or compiled BASIC
	(5.35, 5.36, 6.00, 6.00b, 7.00, or 7.10).
	
	For true multitasking, we recommend using the MS OS/2 operating system
	and Microsoft BASIC Compiler version 6.00 or 6.00b or Microsoft BASIC
	Professional Development System (PDS) version 7.00 or 7.10 for MS-DOS
	and MS OS/2.
	
	For a multiple-user system (for sharing disk and processor resources),
	you can connect multiple computers with the Microsoft OS/2 LAN Manager
	Network.
