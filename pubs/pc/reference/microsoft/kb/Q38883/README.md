	Article: Q38883

	This article summarizes the copyright messages that must be included
	in a program developed for distribution.
	
	If you do not include any run-time modules separate from your
	executable (.EXE) program, then you do not have to include any notice
	of copyright. (In Microsoft BASIC Compilers, you can compile with the
	/O option to make a stand-alone program that does not require a
	separate run-time module.)
	
	You may distribute, free of any royalty fee, the following files only
	if they are a necessary and integrated component of your software
	product.
	
	1. For all Microsoft BASIC Compilers, QuickBASIC, or Microsoft BASIC
	   Professional Development System (PDS), you may distribute the
	   run-time module or run-time DLL, MSHERC.COM (from QuickBASIC 4.50
	   or BASIC PDS 7.00), QBHERC.COM (from QuickBASIC 4.00 or 4.00b),
	   MOUSE.COM, FIXSHIFT.COM, or PATCH87.COM.
	
	2. For Microsoft BASIC PDS, you may also distribute any xxxx.FON
	   file, PROISAM.EXE, PROISAMD.EXE, ISAMIO.EXE, ISAMCVT.EXE,
	   ISAMPACK.EXE, and ISAMREPR.EXE.
	
	If you include any of the above supporting files from a Microsoft
	BASIC product, you must have a copyright notice in both your software
	sign-on message and on your disk labels. It is not necessary to
	include this message in your manuals. The copyright notice should
	appear as follows:
	
	                        Portions (c) Copyright
	                         Microsoft Corporation
	      (Insert the copyright years listed for the language here)
	                          All Rights Reserved.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 2.00, 2.01,
	3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00
	and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and to Microsoft BASIC Professional
	Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
	
	There are no royalty fees for distribution of the supporting files
	listed above.
	
	This information comes from the documents ZRUN1 and ZRUN2, which are
	distributed by Microsoft Customer Service when a customer is concerned
	about copyrights and license agreements for Microsoft Business
	Language products.
