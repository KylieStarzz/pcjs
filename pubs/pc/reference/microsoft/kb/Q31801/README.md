## Q31801: Editor Utilities DOS Version 2.x and 8086/8 Corrections

	Article: Q31801
	Version(s): 1.00
	Operating System: OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | appnote
	Last Modified: 6-JAN-1989
	
	The following files are included in this application note:
	
	   MEGREP.EXE, RM.EXE, UNDEL.EXE, ECH.EXE and EXP.EXE.
	
	These files are replacements for the original utilities that were
	shipped with the Microsoft Editor Version 1.00. They have been updated
	to correct two specific problems only; they do not include any additional
	functionality over the originals.
	
	These files correct the problem of embedded 286 instructions that
	prevented the programs from correctly running on 8086 and 8088
	machines (the machines would hang). The files also have been updated
	to correct problems when used with DOS Version 2.x.
	
	To install the files, copy the files from the appnote disk over the
	files (of the same names) that are installed on the machine.
	
	This application note can be obtained by calling Microsoft Product
	Support Services at (206) 454-2030.
