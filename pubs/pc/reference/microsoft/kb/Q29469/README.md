## Q29469: Mouse Compatibility with IBM PCjr

	The Microsoft Mouse has not been tested with the IBM PCjr. Microsoft's
	PCjr Booster, which was discontinued, was the only official hardware
	that included mouse support (i.e., bus mouse hardware).
	
	We have received customer reports stating that gray-button serial mice
	work properly on the PCjr if a special serial adapter is obtained to
	make the PCjr serial I/O compatible.
	
	We have not confirmed that Microsoft's new white-button mouse will
	work properly with the PCjr using the special adapter.
	
	Solid Rock was a company that provided PCjr accessories, but it has
	since gone out of business.
