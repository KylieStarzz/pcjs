## Q40572: MASM Does Not Support 80386 Flat Model

	Article: Q40572
	Version(s): 4.00 5.00 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 24-APR-1989
	
	The Microsoft Macro Assembler Version 5.10 does not support
	programming in the flat model. The flat model is a memory-organization
	model on the Intel 80386 chip that allows full 32-bit addressing and
	segments greater than 64K.
	
	Microsoft Macro Assembler supports only the tiny-, small-, compact-,
	medium-, and large-memory model. For more information on the flat
	model, consult Intel's "80386 Programmer's Reference Manual."
