## Q59401: Designer Quickwindows Is Alternative Graphics User Interface

	Article: Q59401
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | B_BasicCom
	Last Modified: 9-MAR-1990
	
	This article describes Designer Quickwindows (from Software
	Interphase, Inc.), an add-on product for Microsoft QuickBASIC Version
	4.50 and Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS.
	This product provides an alternative method of producing a Graphical
	User Interface (GUI) in a BASIC program. It can be used instead of
	hand coding your own interface or instead of using the User Interface
	(UI) Toolbox routines provided with Microsoft BASIC Professional
	Development System (PDS) Version 7.00. The product described here is
	manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
	warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
	or reliability.
	
	Software Interphase, Inc. provides a product called "Designer
	Quickwindows," which is a mouse-driven design interface that generates
	BASIC code. This code can then be enhanced with other BASIC code to
	create a full BASIC program. The code generated creates the GUI by
	making calls into the "Quick Windows Advanced Library." This library
	is another product available from Software Interphase.
	
	At the present time, Designer Quickwindows works under Microsoft
	QuickBASIC Versions 4.50 and earlier and under Microsoft BASIC
	Compiler Versions 6.00b and earlier. In the near future, Designer
	Quickwindows should have a version that supports far strings with
	Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00. You can obtain a sample program by calling
	Software Interphase (see below).
