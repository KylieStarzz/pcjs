## Q27252: QuickBASIC Versions 3.00, 4.00, 4.50 Patch for IBM PCjr

	Article: Q27252
	Version(s): 3.00 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 19-JUN-1989
	
	QuickBASIC Versions 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 do not run on the IBM
	PCjr. This incompatibility results from the ROM BIOS of the IBM PCjr,
	which differs from that in a standard IBM PC.
	
	Through individuals who are using QuickBASIC, Microsoft has become
	aware of several versions of a patch that claim to correct this
	incompatibility problem. The following is a list of sources for this
	patch:
	
	1. "The Junior Report" magazine, December 1987, Page 24.
	
	2. On CompuServe, the patch is called INT9JR.ARC, and is located in DL
	   1 of the IBMJR SIG. There is another file called KBFIX.ARC in DL 0
	   of the IBMJR SIG that may do the same thing or may be better.
	
	3. On the Twin City PC bulletin board at (612) 888-0468 or (612)
	   888-7570, the filename for the patch is also INT9JR.ARC.
	
	4. Synetics Software and Systems sells a cartridge called
	   "Quicksilver" that can be used to make QuickC run on the PCjr. A
	   customer reported that this took care of a duplicate-keystroke
	   problem in QuickBASIC. The cartridge costs $34.95, and can be
	   obtained by contacting Synetics Software at the following address
	   and phone number:
	
	      P.O. Box 53501
	      San Jose, CA 95153-0501
	      (408) 281-7780
	
	These patches were developed by individuals who are using QuickBASIC
	on the PCjr, not by Microsoft. Microsoft gives the above references to
	individuals in need of the patch, but in no way supports or guarantees
	the patch.
