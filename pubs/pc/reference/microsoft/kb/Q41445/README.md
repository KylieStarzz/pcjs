	Page 25 The DOS Shell Command
	
	The File menu DOS Shell command lets you exit to DOS. To return to the
	QuickC environment, type EXIT. Do NOT type "QC". If you type "QC" from
	the shell, you load a second copy of QuickC into memory. This might
	cause you to run out of memory when you try to compile a program. Even
	if you don't run out of memory, compiling will slow considerably as
	portions of QuickC are swapped in and out of memory.
