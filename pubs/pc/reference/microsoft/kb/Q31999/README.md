	When an invalid object-module error message occurs, some
	information about the record and the position is printed.
	   This information includes the object record type and the relative
	position of the record in the .OBJ file. There is little you can do
	with this information; it is mainly for compiler and assembler
	developers to point to the wrong object record.
