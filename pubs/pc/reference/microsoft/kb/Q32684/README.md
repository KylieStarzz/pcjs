## Q32684: .CONST Directive Creates a DATA Class Instead of a CONST Class

	Article: Q32684
	Version(s): 5.10   | 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS | OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER | buglist5.10
	Last Modified: 20-JUL-1988
	
	Page 93 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide"
	states that the .CONST directive will produce a segment with CONST
	class; however, the .CONST directive will generate a segment with
	class DATA.
	   Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 5.10. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information as it
	becomes available.
