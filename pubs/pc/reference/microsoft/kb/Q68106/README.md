	Borland's Quattro Pro 2.0 requires mouse switch /Y when you run the
	7.04 mouse driver in graphics mode. This information is contained in
	the readme file that accompanies Quattro Pro 2.0.
	
	The graphics mode in Quattro Pro 2.0 is known as the "Annotate" mode.
	Owners of the Microsoft Mouse and Quattro Pro 2.0 also report that the
	earlier version 6.24b mouse driver will work in any mode of Quattro
	Pro 2.0. Borland recommends that you should not use a Microsoft Mouse
	driver earlier than version 6.10.
