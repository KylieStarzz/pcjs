## Q59728: QB 4.50 Learning to Use Correction; MBF Used Prior to QB 4.00

	Article: Q59728
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S900304-1 docerr
	Last Modified: 26-MAR-1990
	
	This article corrects a documentation error on Page 285 of the
	"Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.5: Learning to Use" manual for Version 4.50.
	
	The following statement in the middle of Page 285 is incorrect:
	
	   Microsoft Binary Format is used by versions of QuickBASIC prior
	   to Version 3.0.
	
	Microsoft Binary Format (MBF) is actually used by versions of
	QuickBASIC prior to 4.00, except for QB87.EXE in QuickBASIC Version
	3.00, which uses IEEE floating-point format. QB.EXE in QuickBASIC 3.00
	uses MBF.
