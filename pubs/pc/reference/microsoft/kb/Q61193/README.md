	Loop Optimization (/Ol)
	-----------------------
	
	The loop optimization option (/Ol) in C 6.00 has a different effect
	than in C 5.10. To get the equivalent of the C 5.10 /Ol option in C
	6.00, use /Ole (loop code optimization and global register
	optimization). See Chapter 1 of "Advanced Programming Techniques" and
	online help for further details.
