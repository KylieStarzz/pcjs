## Q28420: Availability of MENU.COM

	Article: Q28420
	Version(s): 1.00
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 4-NOV-1988
	
	I have obtained a file with the .MNU extension for a third party
	application that requires a file from Microsoft called MENU.COM.
	
	If you have a mouse with driver Version 6.14, the MENU.COM file will
	be on your Mouse Setup Disk.
	
	If you have a version between Version 6.00 and Version 6.14, call
	Microsoft Product Support (206) 454-2030 about obtaining MENU.COM.
	
	If you have a version prior to Version 6.00, you will have the file on
	your System Disk.
