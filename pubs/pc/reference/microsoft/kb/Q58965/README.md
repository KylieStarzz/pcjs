## Q58965: DEF SEG from POKE Help Shows DEF FN Help in 4.50 Online Help

	Article: Q58965
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S900221-73 docerr
	Last Modified: 26-FEB-1990
	
	In the QB Advisor online Help system in Microsoft QuickBASIC Version
	4.50 for MS-DOS, the hyperlink to the DEF SEG statement from the POKE
	statement Help screen incorrectly displays help for the DEF FN
	statement. (The hyperlinks to DEF SEG from PEEK, BLOAD, and BSAVE all
	correctly display the DEF SEG help.)
	
	This hyperlink works correctly in the Microsoft Advisor online Help
	system in the QuickBASIC Extended (QBX.EXE) environment that comes
	with Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) Version
	7.00 for MS-DOS.
