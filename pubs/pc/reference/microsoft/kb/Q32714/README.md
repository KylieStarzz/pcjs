	If you have the new white-button mouse Version 1.00, the
	DEFAULT.COM file, which provides cursor emulation, is located on the
	Mouse Setup Disk. Version 6.00 through 6.10 owners have the
	DEFAULT.COM file located on their Mouse Expert Menus Disk. Mouse
	owners with versions prior to Version 6.00 can write their own menus
	using the mouse menu programming tools (MAKEMENU.EXE and MENU.COM)
	included with their mouse software.
