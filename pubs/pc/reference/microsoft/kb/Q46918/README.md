	Use of the Microsoft Mouse menus is sometimes affected by the style of
	computer keyboard being used. The following are some major versions
	the IBM and IBM-compatible keyboard:
	
	1. The "standard" keyboard came with the original IBM PC. This
	   keyboard includes a numeric keypad on the right-hand side and 10
	   function keys across the top of the keyboard.
	
	2. The "extended" keyboard adds the F11 and F12 function keys to the
	   standard keyboard.
	
	3. The "expanded" keyboard widens the standard keyboard and reproduces
	   the nonnumeric keys and the cursor keys in the additional space.
