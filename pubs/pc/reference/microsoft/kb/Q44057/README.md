## Q44057: MS123 Mouse Menu Not Correctly Positioning Cursor

	If you position the Lotus cursor in 1-2-3 with the mouse cursor on an
	"unprotected cell," the Lotus cursor does not stay positioned on the
	cell selected by the mouse. The cursor jumps to the left or right,
	depending on which part of the cell the mouse cursor is located.
	
	If you position the Lotus cursor with the mouse cursor on "protected"
	cells, the cursor appears to stay positioned.
	
	One workaround in positioning the Lotus cursor with the mouse is to
	place the mouse cursor on the appropriate arrow keys that appear on
	the right side of the screen, or resort to using the keyboard cursor
	keys.
