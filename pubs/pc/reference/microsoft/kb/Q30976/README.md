## Q30976: OS2PATCH for CVP Not Needed in OS/2 Version 1.10.

	Article: Q30976
	Version(s): 2.20 2.30
	Operating System: OS/2
	Flags: ENDUSER |
	Last Modified: 14-NOV-1988
	
	The OS2PATCH supplied with CodeView (protected) Versions 2.20 and
	2.30 allows you to use command 7 on machines with math coprocessors.
	This patch works only with OS/2 Version 1.00. The PTRACE feature was
	updated in Version 1.10, so this patch is not needed in OS/2 Version
	1.10.
	   This patch only works on IBMs version of OS/2 1.00.  If they have
	a different version have them talk to the people who they received
	OS/2 from.  If it was from us then they need to systems languages
	support.
	   Please refer to the file OS2PATCH.DOC for more information.
