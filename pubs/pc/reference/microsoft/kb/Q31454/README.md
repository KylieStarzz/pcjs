	Article: Q31454
	Product: Microsoft C
	Version(s): 5.10
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | docerr

	The following statement appears in the note for Page 130 ("Part 2:
	Notes for the Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler User's Guide") of the
	README.DOC file on the C Version 5.10 Setup disk:
	
	   See the description of the /NOE option under the heading "Linker
	Options" later in this document.
	
	   However, there is no such heading, nor is there any linker option
	information in the UTILITY.DOC file.
	   The CodeView and Utilities manual contains an inserted manual
	section labelled "Update (CV. and Util.)". In this document, the /NOE
	option and the /NON option are described in Section 4, "Using the OS/2
	Linker", subsection 4.3, "New Options for Both Modes", Page Update-28.
