	Disabled Keyboard in OS/2 1.10 Release 88300
	--------------------------------------------
	
	If you are using release 88300 of OS/2 1.10 and running PWB in a
	window, your keyboard may become disabled after choosing Run OS/2
	Command or Execute on the Run menu. If you have this release, contact
	your OS/2 distributor for upgrade information.
	
	This is not a problem with versions of OS/2 other than 88300, nor does
	it occur when running PWB in a full-screen group.
