	Trying to access on-line help after initializing (reloading the editor
	settings from TOOLS.INI) generates the following message:
	
	   Online Help Not Loaded
	
	The following steps will demonstrate the problem:
	
	1. M (Start the editor, with or without a file.)
	
	2. F1 (Request on-line help -- success.)
	
	3. SHIFT+F8 (Initialize editor settings.)
	
	4. F1 (Request on-line help -- receive error message.)
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
	as it becomes available.
