	When editing TextArgs, not all editing features are supported. The
	following features are supported:
	
	QUOTE, INSERT, SDELETE, RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN, HOME, and END
	
	When an unsupported feature is entered, the editor will beep. Macros
	may be used, but they can contain only supported features.
	
	The END key allows you to find the length of the search/replace
	string; pressing ARG clears the entire string.
