	Question:
	
	How can I create multiple windows and edit multiple files with the
	Microsoft Editor?
	
	Response:
	
	Both horizontal and vertical windows can be created. You can have up
	to eight windows on the screen.
	
	To create a horizontal window, position the cursor on the screen where
	you would like the window break and press ARG WINDOW (ALT+A F6 in the
	default).
	
	This process creates a new window with a copy of the file you were
	currently editing. You then can load a different file into that window
	(ARG SETFILE ALT+A F2).
	
	To create a vertical window, position the cursor on the screen where
	you would like the window break and press ARG ARG WINDOW (ALT+A ALT+A
	F6 in the default). You then can load a different file into the
	window.
	
	Once you have several windows on the screen you can move around from
	window to window using the WINDOW command (F6 in the default setup).
	
	See also section 4.6 of the "Microsoft Editor User's Guide."
	
	Note: Each window must have a minimum of five lines and 10 columns to be
	created.
