	The MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS driver must be loaded before attempting
	to load a mouse menu. The "Microsoft Mouse driver not found" error
	message is generated when a mouse expert menu tries to load without
	the mouse driver already loaded.
	   This error message should not be confused with the message "Driver
	not installed-- Microsoft Mouse not found", which is a mouse driver
	not loading message.
