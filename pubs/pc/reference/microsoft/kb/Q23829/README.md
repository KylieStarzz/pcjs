	You cannot write menus in .COM format with the "Mouse
	Programmer's Reference Guide." The reference guide allows you to
	create standard mouse menus, which are installed with the MENU.COM
	file.
	   If you are a developer interested in creating menus in .COM format,
	an Expert Menus Toolkit is available that allows you to create expert
	mouse menus. For more information, call Microsoft Hardware Development
	at (206) 882-8080, and ask for information on Expert Menus Development
	software.
