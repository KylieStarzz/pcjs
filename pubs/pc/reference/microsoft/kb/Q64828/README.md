	The following list outlines reasons why the sample programs included
	with many Microsoft language products might produce warnings when
	compiled:
	
	1. Many of the language elements (for instance, typecasts), which
	   might be necessary to eliminate the warnings, could obscure the
	   points the writer is trying to emphasize.
	
	   The sample programs are included to explain a topic or demonstrate
	   how to use a feature, and might not necessarily reflect model
	   programming practice.
	
	2. The documents are written well before the compiler is finished in
	   the development process. The warnings sometimes change as the
	   compiler progresses. Therefore, it is very difficult to write
	   warning-free code early in the development process and have it
	   compile with no warnings with the release version.
