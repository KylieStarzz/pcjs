	When the 400 dpi Microsoft Mouse is attached to the PS/2 port of the
	Packard-Bell PackMate 2, the Excel 5, and the Legend 5 computers, the
	mouse sometimes does not install correctly.
	
	When the mouse is attached to the serial port there are no
	installation problems.
	
	If you are experiencing this problem, contact Packard-Bell at
	(818) 773-4400.
