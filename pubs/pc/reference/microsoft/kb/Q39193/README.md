## Q39193: Tandy 3000, EGA Card, RGB CM11 Monitor, incompatible w/ 4.50

	Article: Q39193
	Version(s): 4.00 4.50
	Operating System: MS-DOS
	Flags: ENDUSER | SR# S881205-37
	Last Modified: 12-DEC-1988
	
	It has been reported that several QuickBASIC Version 4.50 programs
	(including DEMO1.EXE) fail to run on a Tandy 3000. One customer has a
	built-in EGA card connected to a RGB CM11 monitor. This customer has
	tried this program on several other 3000s, all with EGA monitors. The
	same program works on the customer's 3000 if it is compiled with
	QuickBASIC Version 4.00. There were no TSR's running on the customer's
	system, and the mode co80 and co40 DOS commands had already been
	tried.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 4.50. We are
	researching this problem and wil post new information as it becomes
	available.
