 In return for your support you will receive the very latest edition of this 
manual on a disk, plus one disk of appendixes and references and a third 
disk with source code. That's about two megabytes of raw data when 
uncompressed, or the equivalent of ten manuals the size of the technical 
reference manuals from IBM or Microsoft.

 In addition, supporting users may obtain updates by merely mailing a disk and 
return postage whenever they feel like it.
