Microsoft Systems Journal
---

Microsoft provides a [1986-1994 Index](https://www.microsoft.com/msj/backissues86.aspx) of Microsoft Systems Journal issues.
Unfortunately, the only online issues they currently provide are from January 1993 (Vol. 8, No. 1) through December 1994 (Vol. 9, No. 12).

We have two early Microsoft Systems Journal issues for your out-dated programming enjoyment: October 1986 (Vol. 1, No. 1)
and the OS/2 Issue from May 1987 (Vol. 2, No. 2).
