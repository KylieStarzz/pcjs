DEC PDP-11/20 Publications
---

PDPjs development relied on the following PDP-11/20 publications:

- [PDP-11/20 Handbook (1969)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/archive.pcjs.org/pubs/dec/pdp11/1120/PDP1120_Handbook_1969.pdf) [[Original PDF](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/Digital/PDP%2011%20Handbook%201969.pdf)]
- [PDP-11/20 Handbook (1971)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/archive.pcjs.org/pubs/dec/pdp11/1120/PDP1120_Handbook_1971.pdf) [[Original PDF](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp11/handbooks/PDP1120_Handbook_1972.pdf)]

The above publications actually applied to several PDP-11 models:

- PDP-11/10 (with a minimum of 128 words of read/write memory and 1024 words of read-only memory)
- PDP-11/20 (with a minimum of 4,096 words of read-write memory)

The 1971 Handbook also covered some additional models, which DEC says were "functionally identical":

- PDP-11/15 OEM Computer
- PDP-11R20 Rugged Computer
