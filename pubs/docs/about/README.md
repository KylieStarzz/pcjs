## About PCjs

The [PCjs Project](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs) is a collection of computer simulations written in
[JavaScript](/modules/).  It is an open-source project maintained and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) as
[{{ site.pcjs.domain }}]({{ site.url }}/) (formerly [jsmachines.net](http://jsmachines.net/)).

The goals of the project are to create fast, full-featured simulations of classic computer hardware,
help people understand how these early machines worked, make it easy to experiment with different machine
configurations, and provide a platform for running and analyzing old computer software.

The simulations are written entirely in JavaScript and run well in a variety of web browsers, on both
desktop and mobile devices.  Machines are created with simple XML files that define a set of machine components,
along with the features that each component should enable.  More details about machine definitions and component
capabilities can be found in the [Documentation](/pubs/).

### Simulating the Challenger 1P

The first PCjs simulation was [C1Pjs](/docs/c1pjs/), which emulates the
Challenger 1P, a 6502-based microcomputer introduced by Ohio Scientific in 1978.
C1Pjs v1.0 was released in July 2012.  More information about the first release of C1Pjs was
[posted](http://osiweb.org/osiforum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=103) on the
[OSI Discussion Forum](http://osiweb.org/osiforum/index.php) at [osiweb.org](http://osiweb.org/).

### Simulating the IBM PC

The next PCjs simulation was [PCx86](/docs/about/pcx86/), which emulates the original IBM PC, IBM PC XT,
and IBM PC AT.  PCx86 v1.0 was released in late 2012.  Browse the source code [here](/modules/pcx86/) or on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs).

[PCx86](/docs/about/pcx86/) emulates the Intel 8088, 80186, 80286 and 80386 CPUs, as well as IBM Monochrome Display
Adapter (MDA), Color Graphics Adapter (CGA), Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), and Video Graphics Array (VGA) video
cards, along with assorted motherboard and expansion bus components.  It also includes an optional
[Debugger](/docs/pcx86/debugger/) and a user-configurable [Control Panel](/docs/pcx86/panel/).

Read [About PCx86](/docs/about/pcx86/) to learn more about its history, features, and upcoming improvements.

### Migrating to Node

The PCjs web server was originally written in PHP and hosted by [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) as
[jsmachines.net](http://jsmachines.net/), but in 2014, it was migrated to a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) web server and
hosted by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) as [{{ site.pcjs.domain }}]({{ site.url }}/).

The goals included:

- Using JavaScript exclusively, for both client and server development
- Leveraging the Node.js web server to provide more sophisticated I/O capabilities
- Improving overall website design, including structure, appearance and responsiveness

The PCjs Node web server includes a number of custom Node modules that provide many of the same server-side features
found on [jsmachines.net](http://jsmachines.net/), including new ROM and disk image conversion APIs, and a
Markdown module that supports a subset of the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
including extensions to the link syntax that make it easy to embed PCjs machines in Markdown documents.

### Migrating to GitHub Pages

To simplify hosting requirements, the PCjs Project was migrated to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) in late
2015.  The project still includes the original Node-based web server, which is useful for development and debugging,
but for production sites (including [{{ site.pcjs.domain }}]({{ site.url }}/)), using Jekyll to generate a static copy
of the project for the web is the preferred solution.
