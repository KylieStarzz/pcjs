IBM PC Application Demos
------------------------

Below are selected [PCx86](/docs/about/pcx86/) demos of classic IBM PC applications.  In many cases,
we've had to create our own "Demo Disks", because copies of the original distribution disks are difficult
to find, and in some cases (e.g., [Executive Suite](/apps/pcx86/1982/esuite/)), the original disks were
copy-protected, so we've been forced to use a "cracked" copy of the software instead.

A list of all the software available to PCx86 machines can be found in the [IBM PC Disk Library](/disks/pcx86/).
