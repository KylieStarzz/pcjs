Challenger 1P Applications
--------------------------

[C1Pjs](/docs/c1pjs/) runs Challenger 1P (C1P) applications written in:

- [BASIC](BASIC/)
- [6502 Machine-Language](6502/)

To make it easy for our C1Pjs machines to load these applications, we provide the following **Serial** configuration files:

- [all.xml](all.xml)
- [samples.xml](samples.xml)

These configuration files create UI controls that allow you to choose from a set of BASIC and/or 6502 machine-language
programs that are automatically sent to the C1P's serial port.
