 * WARNING: DEBUGGER needs to accurately reflect whether or not the Debugger component is (or will be) loaded.
 * In the compiled case, we rely on the Closure Compiler to override DEBUGGER as appropriate.  When it's *false*,
 * nearly all of debugger.js will be conditionally removed by the compiler, reducing it to little more than a
 * "type skeleton", which also solves some type-related warnings we would otherwise have if we tried to remove
 * debugger.js from the compilation process altogether.
 *
 * However, when we're in "development mode" and running uncompiled code in debugger-less configurations,
 * I would like to skip loading debugger.js altogether.  When doing that, we must ALSO arrange for an additional file
 * (nodebugger.js) to be loaded immediately after this file, which *explicitly* overrides DEBUGGER with *false*.
