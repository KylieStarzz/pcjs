     *      cycles: the machine's base cycles per second; the X86CPU constructor will provide us with a default
     *      (based on the CPU model) to use as a fallback.
     *
     *      multiplier: base cycle multiplier; default is 1.
     *
     *      autoStart: true to automatically start, false to not, or null if "it depends"; null is the default,
     *      which means do not autostart UNLESS there is no Debugger and no "Run" button (ie, no way to manually
     *      start the machine).
     *
     *      csStart: the number of cycles that runCPU() must wait before generating checksum records;
     *      -1 if disabled.  checksum records are a diagnostic aid used to help compare one CPU run to another.
     *
     *      csInterval: the number of cycles that runCPU() must execute before generating a checksum record;
     *      -1 if disabled.
     *
     *      csStop: the number of cycles to stop generating checksum records.

     * components), and managing overall CPU operation.
