     * The Mouse component has the following component-specific (parmsMouse) properties:
     *
     *      serial: the ID of the corresponding serial component
     *
     * Since the first version of this component supports ONLY emulation of the original Microsoft
     * serial mouse, a valid serial component ID is required.  It's possible that future versions
     * of this component may support other types of simulated hardware (eg, the Microsoft InPort
     * bus mouse adapter), or a virtual driver interface that would eliminate the need for any
     * intermediate hardware simulation (at the expense of writing an intermediate software layer or
     * virtual driver for each supported operating system).  However, those possibilities are extremely
     * unlikely in the near term.
     *
     * If the 'serial' property is specified, then communication will be established with the
     * SerialPort component, requesting access to the corresponding serial component ID.  If the
     * SerialPort component is not installed and/or the specified serial component ID is not present,
     * a configuration error will be reported.
     *
     * TODO: Just out of curiosity, verify that the Microsoft Bus Mouse used ports 0x23D and 0x23F,
     * because I saw Windows v1.01 probing those ports immediately prior to probing COM2 (and then COM1)
     * for a serial mouse.

                     * might send additional bytes, but you would think that newer mouse drivers (eg, MOUSE.COM v8.20)
                     * would always be able to deal with mice that sent only one byte.
                     *
                     * You would be wrong.  On an INT 0x33 reset, the v8.20 driver looks for an 'M', then it waits for
                     * another byte (0x42 aka 'B').  If it doesn't receive a 'B', it will accept another 'M'.  But if it
                     * receives something else (or nothing at all), it will spend a long time waiting for it, and then

                     *
                     * It's entirely possible that I've done something wrong and inadvertently "tricked" MOUSE.COM into
                     * using the wrong detection logic.  But given the other problems I've seen in MOUSE.COM v8.20, including
                     * its failure to properly terminate-and-stay-resident when its initial INT 0x33 reset returns an error,
                     * I'm not in the mood to give it the benefit of the doubt.
                     *
                     * So, anyway, I solve the terminate-and-stay-resident bug in MOUSE.COM v8.20 by feeding it *two* ID_SERIAL
                     * bytes on a reset.  This doesn't seem to adversely affect serial mouse emulation for Windows 1.01, so

 * From http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/serialmouse:
 *
 *      The old MicroSoft serial mouse, while no longer in general use, can be employed to provide a low cost input device,
 *      for example, coupling the internal mechanism to other moving objects. The serial protocol for the mouse is:
 *
 *          1200 baud, 7 bit, 1 stop bit, no parity.
 *
 *      The pinout of the connector follows the standard serial interface, as shown below:
 *
 *          Pin     Abbr    Description
 *          1       DCD     Data Carrier Detect
 *          2       RD      Receive Data            [serial data from mouse to host]
 *          3       TD      Transmit Data
 *          4       DTR     Data Terminal Ready     [used to provide positive voltage to mouse, plus reset/detection]
 *          5       SG      Signal Ground
 *          6       DSR     Data Set Ready
 *          7       RTS     Request To Send         [used to provide positive voltage to mouse]
 *          8       CTS     Clear To Send
 *          9       RI      Ring
 *
 *      Every time the mouse changes state (moved or button pressed) a three byte "packet" is sent to the serial interface.
 *      For reasons known only to the engineers, the data is arranged as follows, most notably the two high order bits for the
 *      x and y coordinates share the first byte with the button status.
 *
 *                      D6  D5  D4  D3  D2  D1  D0
 *          1st byte    1   LB  RB  Y7  Y6  X7  X6
 *          2nd byte    0   X5  X4  X3  X2  X1  X0
 *          3rd byte    0   Y5  Y4  Y3  Y2  Y1  Y0
 *
 *      where:
 *
 *          LB is the state of the left button, 1 = pressed, 0 = released.
 *          RB is the state of the right button, 1 = pressed, 0 = released
 *          X0-7 is movement of the mouse in the X direction since the last packet. Positive movement is toward the right.
 *          Y0-7 is movement of the mouse in the Y direction since the last packet. Positive movement is back, toward the user.
 *
 * From http://www.kryslix.com/nsfaq/Q.12.html:
 *
 *      The Microsoft serial mouse is the most popular 2-button mouse. It is supported by all major operating systems.
 *      The maximum tracking rate for a Microsoft mouse is 40 reports/second * 127 counts per report, in other words, 5080 counts
 *      per second. The most common range for mice is is 100 to 400 CPI (counts per inch) but can be up to 1000 CPI. A 100 CPI mouse
 *      can discriminate motion up to 50.8 inches/second while a 400 CPI mouse can only discriminate motion up to 12.7 inches/second.
 *
 *          9-pin  25-pin    Line    Comments
 *          shell  1         GND
 *          3      2         TD      Serial data from host to mouse (only for power)
 *          2      3         RD      Serial data from mouse to host
 *          7      4         RTS     Positive voltage to mouse
 *          8      5         CTS
 *          6      6         DSR
 *          5      7         SGND
 *          4      20        DTR     Positive voltage to mouse and reset/detection
 *
 *      To function correctly, both the RTS and DTR lines must be positive. DTR/DSR and RTS/CTS must NOT be shorted.
 *      RTS may be toggled negative for at least 100ms to reset the mouse. (After a cold boot, the RTS line is usually negative.
 *      This provides an automatic toggle when RTS is brought positive). When DTR is toggled the mouse should send a single byte
 *      (0x4D, ASCII 'M').
 *
 *      Serial data parameters: 1200bps, 7 data bits, 1 stop bit
 *
 *      Data is sent in 3 byte packets for each event (a button is pressed or released, or the mouse moves):
 *
 *                  D7  D6  D5  D4  D3  D2  D1  D0
 *          Byte 1  X   1   LB  RB  Y7  Y6  X7  X6
 *          Byte 2  X   0   X5  X4  X3  X2  X1  X0
 *          Byte 3  X   0   Y5  Y4  Y3  Y2  Y1  Y0
 *
 *      LB is the state of the left button (1 means down).
 *      RB is the state of the right button (1 means down).
 *      X7-X0 movement in X direction since last packet (signed byte).
 *      Y7-Y0 movement in Y direction since last packet (signed byte).
 *      The high order bit of each byte (D7) is ignored. Bit D6 indicates the start of an event, which allows the software to
 *      synchronize with the mouse.
