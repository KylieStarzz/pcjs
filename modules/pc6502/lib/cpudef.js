     * This constant is used to mark points in the code where the physical address being returned
     * is invalid and should not be used.
     *
     * In a 32-bit CPU, -1 (ie, 0xffffffff) could actually be a valid address, so consider changing
     * ADDR_INVALID to NaN or null (which is also why all ADDR_INVALID tests should use strict equality
     * operators).
     *
     * The main reason I'm NOT using NaN or null now is my concern that, by mixing non-numbers
     * (specifically, values outside the range of signed 32-bit integers), performance may suffer.
     *
     * WARNING: Like many of the properties defined here, ADDR_INVALID is a common constant, which the
     * Closure Compiler will happily inline (with or without @const annotations; in fact, I've yet to
     * see a @const annotation EVER improve automatic inlining).  However, if you don't make ABSOLUTELY
     * certain that this file is included BEFORE the first reference to any of these properties, that
     * automatic inlining will no longer occur.
