 * Bus(cpu, dbg)
 *
 * The Bus component manages physical memory and I/O address spaces.
 *
 * The Bus component has no UI elements, so it does not require an init() handler,
 * but it still inherits from the Component class and must be allocated like any
 * other device component.  It's currently allocated by the Computer's init() handler,
 * which then calls the initBus() method of all the other components.
 *
 * When initMemory() initializes the entire address space, it also passes aMemBlocks
 * to the CPU object, so that the CPU can perform its own address-to-block calculations
 * (essential, for example, when the CPU enables paging).
 *
 * For memory beyond the simple needs of the ROM and RAM components (ie, memory-mapped
 * devices), the address space must still be allocated through the Bus component via
 * addMemory().  If the component needs something more than simple read/write storage,
 * it must provide a custom controller.

 *
 * We've relaxed some of the original requirements (ie, that addresses must start at a

 * because machines with large block sizes can make it impossible to load certain ROMs at
 * their required addresses.  Every allocation still allocates a whole number of blocks.

 * Even so, Bus memory management does NOT provide a general-purpose heap.  Most memory
 * allocations occur during machine initialization and never change.  In particular, there
 * is NO support for removing partial-block allocations.
 *
 * Each Memory block keeps track of a start address (addr) and length (used), indicating
 * the used space within the block; any free space that precedes or follows that used space
 * can be allocated later, by simply extending the beginning or ending of the previously used
 * space.  However, any holes that might have existed between the original allocation and an

 * In a normal 4Kb block, there will be 1K DWORD values in the data array.  Remember that each DWORD is a signed 32-bit
 * integer (because they are formed using bitwise operator rather than floating-point math operators), so don't be
 * surprised to see negative numbers in the data.
 *
 * The above example assumes "uncompressed" data arrays.  If we choose to use "compressed" data arrays, the data arrays
 * will look like:
 *
 *      [count0, dw0, count1, dw1, ...]
 *
 * where each count indicates how many times the following DWORD value occurs.  A data array length less than 1K indicates
 * that it's compressed, since we'll only store them in compressed form if they actually shrank, and we'll use State
 * helper methods compress() and decompress() to create and expand the compressed data arrays.
