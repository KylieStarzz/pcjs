    /**
     * Time(idMachine, idControl, config)
     *
     * Sample config:
     *
     *      "clock": {
     *        "class": "Time",
     *        "cyclesPerSecond": 1600000,       // number of cycles per second
     *        "bindings": {
     *          "run": "runTI57",
     *          "print": "printTI57"
     *        }
     *      }
     *
     * Example: The TI-57 has a standard cycle time of 0.625us.  Every set of four cycles
     * is designated a "state time".  Within a single state time (2.5us), the four cycles are
     * designated O1, P1, O2, and P2.  Moreover, one state time is required to transfer 2 bits
     * from a data word register.  Since a data word consists of 16 BCD digits, that's 64 bits,
     * or 32 state times, or 80us.  That being the longest operation an instruction may perform,
     * one instruction is typically 80us.  Exceptions include display instructions, which slow
     * the delivery of cycles, such that one state time is 10us instead of 2.5us, and therefore
     * the instruction takes 320us instead of 80us.
     *
     * All that being said, the smallest division of time we must be concerned with is the 0.625us
     * cycle time, which means there are 1,600,000 cycles per second.
     *
     * Other components that need to be aware of the passage of time can register a "refresh"
     * function via addRefresh() (called with frequency REFRESHES_PER_SECOND), as well as a "timer"
     * function via addTimer().  Timers can either be manually or automatically set to fire after
     * a predetermined number of microseconds; at the point a timer is armed, the requested number
     * of microseconds is converted to the number of cycles the machine is expected to process
     * during that number of microseconds, and when that cycle count is exhausted, the timer
     * function is called.
