/*
 * Provides support for a variety of LED types:
 *
 * 1) LED Light (single light)
 * 2) LED Array (two-dimensional)
 * 3) LED Digits (1 or more 7-segment digits)
 *
 * To prototype this, I want to be able to include "led.js" and call an interface with a JSON object
 * that describes the type, style (eg, round or square), color, and size.
 *
 * The initial goal is to generate a 12-element array of 7-segment LED digits.
 *
 * We will need to create a canvas element inside the specified container element.  There must be interfaces
 * for enabling/disabling/toggling power to any combination of xSelect and ySelect.  There must also be a time
 * interface to indicate the passage of time, which should be called a minimum of every 1/60th of a second;
 * any addressable LED segment that was last toggled more than 1/60th second earlier will be blanked.
