 Provides support for a variety of LED types:

 1) LED Light (single light)
 2) LED Array (two-dimensional)
 3) LED Digits (1 or more 7-segment digits)

 To prototype this, I want to be able to include "led.js" and call an interface with a JSON object
 that describes the type, style (eg, round or square), color, and size.

 The initial goal is to generate a 12-element array of 7-segment LED digits.

 Sample JSON:

    {
        machine: "ti57",
        container: "display",
        type: 3,
        xSize: 96,
        ySize: 128,
        xTotal: 12,
        yTotal: 1
    }

 We will need to create a canvas element inside the specified container element.  There must be interfaces
 for enabling/disabling/toggling power to any combination of xSelect and ySelect.  There must also be a time
 interface to indicate the passage of time, which should be called a minimum of every 1/60th of a second;
 any addressable LED segment that was last toggled more than 1/60th second earlier will be blanked.
