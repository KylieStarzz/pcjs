/*
 * Options
 * ---
 * The 'includeObjectConstants' option allows replacement of constants defined within objects,
 * instead of only global constants. Use with caution, because constants defined within an object
 * scope may not be unique.  This does attempt to catch any constant collisions and completely
 * disable their replacement, but it's not foolproof.
 *
 * History
 * ---
 * Although we run all our code through Google's Closure Compiler, which does a great job of inlining
 * not only variables but also code to improve performance, JavaScript doesn't have the notion of
 * "constants", so we have to define all our constants as properties and simply trust that the Closure
 * Compiler will inline them all.  I'm not completely trusting, so I've created this script that allows
 * us to verify the compiler produces substantially the same code whether or not we inline all our
 * constants first.
 *
 * See "inline.php" for the original PHP version of this module.
 *
 * Conventions
 * ---
 * This script looks for global constant definitions of the form "Component.XXX = YYY;".
 *
 * The current approach requires all inlined constants to be defined as properties on the associated
 * class constructor (ie, as "class constants").  Life might be simpler if the Closure Compiler honored
 * "@const" references for properties, and who knows, perhaps the latest version does now; but on the
 * other hand, having my own convention relieves me from having to annotate every single constant with
 * a "@const" JSDoc tag.
 *
 * TODO: Update the C1Pjs sources to use class constants instead of "object constants", because in order
 * for C1Pjs to benefit from constant inlining, we must reply on the 'includeObjectConstants' option
 * (hack) to expand the contexts that constants may live in, which is inherently less safe.  Moreover,
 * that option prevents us from removing the original constant definitions, because constants like
 * "this.PORT_CRA" could be used in other contexts that this script will NOT catch (eg, "controller.PORT_CRA").
 *
 * TODO: Think about adding another quick hack to this tool, to convert all:
 *
 *      at-param {Debugger} dbg
 * to:
 *      at-param {Component} dbg
 *
 * prior to compilation.  The only reason I declared my "dbg" variables generically, as Component objects
 * rather than Debugger objects, was to work around compilation errors in the non-Debugger builds.
 *
 * Implementation
 * ---
 * This script uses a very simplistic replacement approach that doesn't perform any parsing, tokenizing
 * or other pre-processing of the source code, which would otherwise be required if we wanted to guarantee
 * that all our replacements precisely mirrored what JavaScript actually replaces at run-time.  For example,
 * JavaScript allows any so-called constant to be redefined at any point, and we don't attempt to catch
 * modifications.
 *
 * This is why it's important that we limit inlining to only those constants described above, and why such
 * constants must never be altered by the code using them.
 *
 * Debugging
 * ===
 * Use the following command to debug this task (after making Chrome your default browser):
 *
 *      node-debug $(which grunt) prepjs
 *
 * which required installing "node-inspector" first:
 *
 *      sudo npm install -g node-inspector
 *
 * You may also want to enable the heapdump code below, which required installing "heapdump" first:
 *
 *      npm install heapdump --save-dev
 *
 * TODO: Resolve once and for all the "process out of memory" error that occurs if we don't divide the src input
 * into smaller chunks.  See the WARNING below.

         *      matchBase: If set, patterns without slashes will be matched against the basename of the path
