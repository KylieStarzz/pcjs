     * State(component, sVersion, sSuffix)

     * State objects are used by components to save/restore their state.
     *
     * During a save operation, components add data to a State object via set(), and then return
     * the resulting data using data().
     *
     * During a restore operation, the Computer component passes the results of each data() call
     * back to the originating component.
     *
     * WARNING: Since State objects are low-level objects that have no UI requirements, they do not
     * inherit from the Component class, so you should only use class methods of Component, such as
     * Component.assert() (or Debugger methods if the Debugger is available).
     *
     * NOTE: 1.01 is the first version to provide limited save/restore support using localStorage.
     * From that point on, care must be taken to insure that any new version that's incompatible with
     * previous localStorage data be released with a version number that is at least 1 greater,
     * since we're tagging the localStorage data with the integer portion of the version string.
