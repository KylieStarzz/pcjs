 * PRIVATE enables certain private features that we don't want enabled on the public web server, so by default,
 * PRIVATE is false.  For Jekyll configurations, if site.pcjs.private is set, this file gets included, overriding
 * the default.
 *
 * Currently, the only (checked-in) use of the private setting is to set the client's PRIVATE global and trigger
 * the loading of alternate (ie, private) XML files in embed.js.
