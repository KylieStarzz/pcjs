TopView 1.01
------------

NOTE: Even though we've made every effort to mark all PCjs pages as English, Google's Chrome web browser (v59)
mistakenly thinks this page is in French and will attempt to translate it to English.  That translation process
interferes with elements of the machine; for example, it may change the name of the first diskette drive from
"A:" to "AT:".

So, if you notice any rendering problems, check the top of your web browser, and if you see the message *This page
has been translated from French to English*, click **Show Original**.  Ironically, the addition of these two
paragraphs of English text will likely eliminate the problem.
