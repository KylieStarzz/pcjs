TopView 1.01
------------

From IBM's [August 14, 1984 Announcement Letter](http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/2/897/ENUS284-282/index.html&lang=en&request_locale=en):

> The IBM Personal Computer TopView program and TopView Programmer's ToolKit provide windowing capability with
concurrent execution of multiple applications.

> Highlights:

> - Windowing capability provided.
> - Concurrent execution of multiple applications (multitasking) allowed.
> - A user-supplied 'mouse' as a pointing device.
> - Both text and graphics applications allowed.
> - User may cut/copy and paste between windows.
> - Interactive tutorial and HELP text included.

The machine below is configured to automatically start TopView 1.01 on top of PC-DOS 2.00.  No mouse driver is loaded,
so you must use TopView's "Keyboard Mouse" support: arrow keys move the cursor and **Home**, **PgUp**, and **Alt**
act as mouse buttons.

To manually start TopView: {% include machine-command.html type='button' label='Load' machine='ibm5160' command='startTV' %}
{% endcomment %}
