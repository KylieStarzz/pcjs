MicroPro WordStar for PCjr
--------------------------

[Directory Listings](#directory-of-wordstar-for-pcjr-disk-1) of the double-sided (360Kb) WordStar for PCjr diskettes
are provided below.  The disk images were obtained from [WinWorld](https://winworldpc.com/product/wordstar/for-pcjr).

It's worth noting that, despite being called "WordStar for PCjr", this version of WordStar appears to work fine on non-PCjr
configurations, including the one below, which also has twice the memory (256Kb) that the PCjr supported (128Kb).  We've
taken care to boot [PC-DOS 2.10](/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/2.10/) for this demo, because it's possible that WordStar for PCjr has
some dependencies on that version of DOS (since the PCjr required PC-DOS 2.10 or later).

We have also included another variation of the WordStar for PCjr binary (`WS.EXE`) on
[Disk 1](#directory-of-wordstar-for-pcjr-disk-1), exactly as it was provided to us by a former MicroPro employee.  It
is slightly smaller than the "official" PCjr binary (`WSU.EXE`), but given that both files have dates well past the apparent
release date of August 17, 1984, it's not clear to what extent *either* of the programs on Disk 1 can be considered "official".
