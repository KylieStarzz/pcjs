One important new feature of MS-DOS 4.00 was the ability to update the system files (IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS)
of any boot disk, by moving the first two directory entries (and the contents of the first three data sectors)
as needed to make room for the new IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS files.

The SYS command in older versions of MS-DOS would report "No room for system on destination disk" if the first
two directory entries (or the first three data sectors) were unavailable.  However, after using the MS-DOS 4.00
SYS command, it usually becomes possible to install older MS-DOS versions as well.

Learn more about the history of the SYS command from [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/66530).
