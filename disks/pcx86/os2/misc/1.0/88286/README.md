OS/2 1.0 Debugger Boot Disk
---------------------------

This disk contained a version of OS/2 1.0 built on October 12, 1988, which included the built-in kernel debugger
used by Microsoft and IBM for internal development, along with a rudimentary program selector.

Note that [IBM OS/2 1.0](/disks/pcx86/os2/ibm/1.0/) was finalized in October 1987, nearly a year before the timestamps
of these files, indicating that this was a private build of IBM OS/2 1.0.  When this disk boots, the following version
banner is displayed:

	IBM Operating System/2 Version 1.00
	(C) Copyright IBM Corp. 1981, 1987. All rights reserved.
	(C) Copyright Microsoft Corp. 1981, 1987.
	
	88286

The 5-digit number indicates the day the files were built.  The first 2 digits (88) are the year and the 3 remaining
digits (286) are the day of the year (October 12).

A directory listing of this disk is provided [below](#directory-of-os2-10-debugger-boot-disk).

### Directory of OS/2 1.0 Debugger Boot Disk

Aside from the fact that the IBMDOS.COM on this disk is much larger than the 1987 version (thanks to the inclusion of
the kernel debugger), most of the other file sizes are identical.  But not all.  For example, the 1987 version of
CLOCK01.SYS is 2762 bytes, whereas this version is 2812 bytes.  So apparently a few changes were slipped into the 1.0
sources used to build these binaries.
