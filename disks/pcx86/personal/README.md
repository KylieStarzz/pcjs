> NOTES: This was originally an MS-DOS 3.20 Distribution Disk (Disk 2 of 2) which I had subsequently modified for
personal use.  Presumably to make more room on the disk, I had moved off a few MS-DOS 3.20 files (BACKUP.EXE,
RESTORE.EXE, SHARE.EXE, TREE.EXE, and XCOPY.EXE), updated DEBUG.EXE, added MASM.EXE (v4.00), and then included
a few files of my own (eg, PCPAL.EXE and HDISK.ASM).  FYI, this particular copy of PCPAL.EXE was saved with **Alt-Esc**
configured as the activation key sequence. *--@jeffpar*
