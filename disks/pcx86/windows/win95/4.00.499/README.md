Microsoft Windows 95 (Build 499)
--------------------------------

The PCjs Project was first to unearth this pre-release version of Windows 95 since its *extremely* limited
test release back in June 1995.  It was one of the last (if not *the* last) test versions produced before
[Windows 95](/disks/pcx86/windows/win95/4.00.950/) was released to manufacturing on July 14, 1995 and went on sale
at midnight on August 24, 1995.

This pre-release is an upgrade version consisting of 13 1.44Mb diskettes.  You can use the machine below to test the
installation process.  Start with "Windows 95 (Build 499 Disk 1)" in Drive A.
