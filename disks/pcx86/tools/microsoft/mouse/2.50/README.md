Microsoft Mouse 2.50
--------------------

NOTE: The [MS Mouse 2.50 (Bus)](#ms-mouse-250-bus) diskette is from a "Microsoft Word with Microsoft Mouse combination package",
and it appears to be a complete copy of the original diskette, whereas the [MS Mouse 2.50 (Serial)](#ms-mouse-250-serial) diskette
is a custom diskette that contains only the 2.50 serial mouse drivers, perhaps from a different Microsoft Word bundle.  Since
the serial drivers were not perserved inside an original disk image, the difference in timestamps is not meaningful.
All files were obtained via [WinWorld](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-mouse/2x).
