	Dear Macro Assembler Customer,
	
	This incremental update provides fixes for the problems
	described below. In general, the problems
	fixed are the ones most frequently reported to us.  The next
	full update of Macro Assembler will address other problems.
	
	If you find any other problems with the Macro Assembler,
	please contact us at (206) 454-2030.  We are very interested
	in tracking all problems found with MASM to ensure that they
	are fixed in future releases.  Your feedback is invaluable!
	
	Sincerely,
	
	System Languages Group
	Microsoft Product Support Services
	
	                Problems Fixed in MASM 5.10a
	
	     o    Modified alignment constraints for variables
	          allocated with the LOCAL directive.
	          
	          Padding bytes are used to enforce the following
	          constraints:
	          
	          Type Specifier                Align Type
	               BYTE                        BYTE
	               WORD                        WORD
	               DWORD                       DWORD
	               FWORD                       WORD
	               QWORD                       DWORD
	               TBYTE                       WORD
	          
	          Offset for local variables whose size is greater
	          than WORD is now correctly calculated.
	     
	     o    With /Zi, Codeview information is now generated
	          for all symbols defined with the LOCAL directive.
	     
	     o    The text macros for parameters and locals with the
	          PROC directive are generated with surrounding
	          parentheses.  This aids in their correct
	          evaluation in expressions.
	     
	     o    USES clauses in PROC directives no longer
	          generates internal assembler errors.
	     
	     o    Open procedures no longer cause listing file
	          errors.
	     
	     o    SUBSTR can now be used with the same label as both
	          source and destination.
	     
	     o    EXTRN ABS when C language is specified prepends
	          name with an underscore.
	     
	     o    Parameter alignment in 32 bit mode has been
	          adjusted.  6 bytes were previously allocated for
	          the return address, but 8 bytes are pushed by the
	          calling program.
	     
	     o    32 bit fixup records are now being output in 16
	          bit code segments.
	     
	     o    Unintentionally redefining a code label in a PROC
	          no longer causes the assembler to hang.
	     
	     o    MASM will now run in a VIO window under
	          Presentation Manager.
	     
	               Problems Fixed in MASM 5.10a, Cont.
	     
	     o    .CONST now generates a 'CONST' class segment as
	          documented.  Previously, it was generating class
	          'DATA'.
	     
	     o    /Z switch is no longer ignored after an include
	          file is processed.
	     
	     o    Can now mix / and \ in the command line source
	          file path specification, i.e.:
	          
	          masm -t \masm/src/file.asm;
	     
	     o    Fixed GP fault on command line longer than 127
	          characters.
	     
	     o    Fixed bug which caused errors to be reported with
	          the wrong line numbers.
	     
	     o    Fixed a phase-error problem with:
	          
	           MOV BX, forward-reference expression
	     
	     o    Fixed improper behavior when type missing on LABEL
	          directive.
	     
	     o    Real number initialization now works when .RADIX
	          16.  Previously, a false "non-digit in number"
	          error was generated.
	     
	     o    Can now initialize a structure field to a segment
	          address.  Previously, initializing a DD to a
	          segmentName generated an invalid object file.
	     
	     o    % operator no longer inconsistently causes "symbol
	          not defined" errors when used with text equates.
	     
	     o    Text macro expansions no longer cause GP faults.
