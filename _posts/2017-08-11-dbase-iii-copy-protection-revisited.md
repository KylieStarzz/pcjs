title: dBASE III Copy Protection Revisited

One of the earliest tasks I remember tackling on an IBM PC was a basically a favor for my father-in-law, Tom Estelita.
In 1984, he had purchased a copy of dBASE III and had become frustrated by its copy-protection.  The previous version,
dBASE II, had no such protection, which probably added to his frustration.  At the time, he was running his own tiny
software company, Radix 2 Software, and he certainly wasn't interested in redistributing dBASE III -- he just wanted to
be able to back-up his software and switch between a handful of machines without the hassle or worry of relying on a
single fragile copy-protected diskette.

At that time, my day job was writing PDP-11 application software, but I really wanted to learn more about the IBM PC,
and I had done work for Tom in the past (writing BASIC accounting software on CP/M-based machines), so he made me a
deal: he would loan me a floppy-based IBM PC and some IBM reference manuals, in exchange for attempting to crack dBASE
III's copy-protection.

I have no recollection of how feasible I thought this challenge was, but I'm sure I jumped at the opportunity.
Perhaps my thinking was that, after all, it's just software, so how hard could it be.  In any case, I apparently took
the challenge very seriously, because I also made a lot of notes.

I recently found [those notes](/docs/personal/#dbase-iii-copy-protection), along with copies of the
[dBASE III disks](/disks/pcx86/apps/other/dbase3/1.0/) used.  Unfortunately, all they contained was my *patched*
(unlocked) version of `DBASE.EXE`, and for the sake of a complete archive, I wanted the *unpatched* (locked) version as
well.  Fortunately, my patching notes also show all the original bytes, so I reproduced the original file by reversing
the patching process, using PCjs:

I haven't examined this patch again (yet), but I will admit that it seems rather lengthy.  Usually one strives for
a very small, surgically precise patch that's more on the order of 3 or 4 bytes, but we have to remember that I wasn't
very familiar with either the IBM PC or the 8088 instruction set at this point -- this was also a learning exercise.

And who knows, maybe Vault Corporation (the company that Ashton-Tate used to provide the copy-protection logic for
dBASE III) wrote such sophisticated code that it was impossible to defeat so simply.  However, experience suggests
that's unlikely.
