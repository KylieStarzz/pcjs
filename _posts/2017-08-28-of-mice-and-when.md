While trying to bring the PCjs [Microsoft Mouse Driver](/disks/pcx86/tools/microsoft/mouse/) collection up-to-date,
at least through the 1980's, a number of versions have proven hard to find: 

- Microsoft Mouse v1.x
- Microsoft Mouse v2.x (Serial Version)
- Microsoft Mouse v3.x
- Microsoft Mouse v5.x

However, I was able to locate [Microsoft Mouse v5.0](/disks/pcx86/tools/microsoft/mouse/5.00/) disk images in my own
collection, so we can cross that one off the list now.

Another dimension of the driver matrix is the type of mouse hardware:

- Bus
- Serial
- InPort
- PS/2
- USB
- Bluetooth

Since my focus is the 1980's, we'll ignore USB and Bluetooth for now.

There seems to be a fair bit of confusion on the Internet about Microsoft's first mouse: the Bus Mouse.  For example,
I found this [Reverse-engineered Bus Mouse Driver](https://github.com/fr1tz/aimsgui/blob/master/aid/os/pc/devmouse.c),
which is clearly making educated guesses about what the various I/O ports do.  There's nothing wrong with that,
and in fact, we have little choice in the matter, because I don't think Microsoft ever published technical details
of any of their mouse hardware.  Unfortunately, after studying the driver a bit, I discovered that what it thinks
is a Microsoft Bus Mouse is actually a newer mouse: the Microsoft InPort Mouse.

Even this Wikipedia article on the [Microsoft Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Mouse) gets it wrong:

> The initial version featured an InPort ISA interface, requiring a Microsoft bus card to be installed in the computer.

The first Microsoft Mouse, introduced in 1983, was available in Serial and Bus versions.  The Serial version required
a serial port using a DB-25 connector, while the Bus version came with a small ISA card that connected to the mouse
with a smaller DB-9 connector.

Fast-forward to 1986, when Microsoft announced the InPort chip.  As of May 9, 1986, all of its "Bus" mice were
reportedly shipping with the InPort chip, along with a new, round 9-pin connector (not to be confused with the round
6-pin connector that IBM introduced in 1987 and is now known as the PS/2 interface).

It's easy to see why the original Microsoft Bus mouse is so easily confused with the Microsoft InPort mouse, since
they both required plugging an ISA card into your PC's bus.  But the mice used different connectors and the cards had
different programming interfaces.  They used the same range of ports by default (0x23C through 0x23F), but the
InPort chip added a number of registers that could only be accessed by first writing a register number to the card's
"Address" port (0x23C) and then reading or writing that register through the card's "Data" port (0x23D).

This post barely scratches the surface of the evolution of the Microsoft Mouse, the various shapes and sizes of mice
and their connectors, and all the programming considerations (eg, detection, initialization, interrupt handling, etc.)
I'll return to this topic in the coming months, once I have more time, but for now, I'll leave you with this tiny
snapshot of mouse driver revision history that I recently unearthed.  Enjoy!

	;         determine if the InPort is to be used in timer interrupt mode
	;         (version 1.0) or timer interrupt mode (all other versions).  if
	;         the 1.1 version of the chip checks out in data interrupt mode, this

	;       - moved EGA mode D cursor buffer to 3f40h from 1fd0h
	; 6.00
	;       - modified version numbers
	; 6.01A
	;       - modified version numbers

	;         of 1 & 2 are handled correctly
	;       - added code to set external timer enable bit in the InPort test
	;         register if timer select (interrupt rate) is set to 7 and the InPort
	;         chip version isn't 1.0
	;       - added the variable ChipVersion to hold the InPort chip version #
	;       - deleted all calls to disable and the disable subroutine (calls to

	;         a Hercules graphics adapter display mode

	;       - added more comments to cursor drawing routines
	;       - modified move_cursors and move3 for speed & reduced cursor width
	;         (max cursor width changed from 8 bytes to 4 bytes - 6.01B)
	;       - added Ericsson support
	;       - modified set_masks to use ROM BIOS data area crt columns & display
	;         mode to determine value for bytes_per_line to support Hercules 90
	;         column text mode
	;       - corrected scan line # output for int 10h read lightpen position when
	;         in high resolution modes
