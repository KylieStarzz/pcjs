Initial goals for 2014 include

- Setting up a new web server running node.js, using either AWS, Google Compute Engine or Windows Azure;
- Porting this project to work with node.js, which includes rewriting all the PHP code as server-side JavaScript;
- Deciding whether to move PCx86 and C1Pjs to their own websites, or host all machines on PCjs.org;
- Deciding how best (or even whether) to accomodate PCjs running from both **node** and **non-node** web servers.

I guess we'll learn more as the year progresses.
