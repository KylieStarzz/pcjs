This is an update to my 2014 [post](/blog/2014/08/01/) on the PCjs online collection of old
[PC Tech Journal](/pubs/pc/magazines/pctj/) magazine issues.
 
Our collection is much more complete now.  We have the first issue, the last issue, and almost all the issues
in between.  All we're currently missing are the first three issues of 1989, at least in terms of regular issues.

We also have the [1987 Editorial Index and Comprehensive Product Guide](/pubs/pc/magazines/pctj/PCTJ-1987-00/);
however, even though it identifies itself as a 1987 issue, the editorial index only covers issues through
October 1986, so "technically" it should be considered a late 1986 issue.  It is officially Vol. 4, No. 13, which,
numerically, puts it squarely between the December 1986 and January 1987 issues.

Happy reading!
