As part of an ongoing effort to make classic PC technical literature more accessible, I just finished
scanning and posting the 12 issues of [PC Tech Journal](/pubs/pc/magazines/pctj/) from 1987.

![PC Tech Journal, Jan 1987](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/archive.pcjs.org/pubs/pc/magazines/pctj/PCTJ-1987-01/thumbs/PCTJ-1987-01 1.jpeg "link:/pubs/pc/magazines/pctj/PCTJ-1987-01/:200:260")

Future PC Tech Journal postings will include:

- Vol. 1, No. 1, July-August 1983
- Vol. 3, No. 12, December 1985
- Vol. 4, Nos. 1-12, 1986
- Vol. 6, Nos. 1-12, 1988

I'm missing the rest of 1983, all of 1984, most of 1985, and all of 1989 (well, through April 1989, which was
apparently the last issue).
  
For a nice overview and brief history of PC Tech Journal, check out the [OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/?p=2478). 

In the meantime, if you have old PC Tech Journal issues that would fill any of the above holes, let me know.
I'd be happy to buy them, scan them, and recycle them.

Thanks.
