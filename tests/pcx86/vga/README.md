VGA "Black Book" Tests
----------------------

To aid in the development of PCjs VGA support, I've added some VGA tests to the project.
For now, the only "tests" are samples taken directly from
[Michael Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book](https://github.com/jeffpar/abrash-black-book), which you
can run in the [VGA "Black Book" Test Machine](#vga-black-book-test-machine) below.

Abrash's book is available on many sites, but I'm partial to the Markdown version that [James Gregory](https://github.com/jagregory)
has made available on GitHub, because (a) it's a brilliant way to render and share the text, and (b) it apparently has
Abrash's blessing, so I feel more comfortable forking it, using it, and resharing it.

The main reasons for my [fork](https://github.com/jeffpar/abrash-black-book) are to make the book's
images display properly on GitHub, and to extract and add assorted source code listings as I need them.  Since that
project's [/src](https://github.com/jeffpar/abrash-black-book/tree/master/src) folder contains just the book's text,
I've added a [/code](https://github.com/jeffpar/abrash-black-book/tree/master/code) folder for the source code listings.
The name of each source code file matches the name displayed in the text (eg, [L23-1.ASM](L23-1.ASM) is Listing 23.1
from [Chapter 23](https://github.com/jeffpar/abrash-black-book/blob/master/src/chapter-23.md)).

I assume something similar was done on the CD-ROM that accompanied the Black Book, but since I don't have the original
book or its CD-ROM, I'm extracting the source code directly from the Markdown text, and then "tabifying" it with 8-column
tab stops.

Development of PCjs VGA support has just begun (June 2015), so don't expect everything here to to run properly yet.

Also, I've updated the PCjs [Library](/disks/pcx86/library.xml) disk collection to include a disk containing executables
built from the sources in this directory:

```xml
<disk path="/tests/pcx86/vga/VGABIN.json">VGA Tests (Black Book)</disk>
```

The "VGA Tests (Black Book)" disk image (VGABIN) was built with this command:

	diskdump --dir=bin --format=json --output=VGABIN.json

Alternatively, if *path* refers to a directory (ending with a slash) instead of a disk image, the PCjs client will ask
the PCjs web server to enumerate the contents of that directory and send back a JSON-encoded disk image containing all
the files in that directory (including any subdirectories) every time that disk is requested.  Since this puts an added
burden on the server, it's best to do this only when running PCjs from a local PCjs web server.

```xml
<disk path="/tests/pcx86/vga/">VGA Tests (Black Book)</disk>
```

One advantage of using [DiskDump](/modules/diskdump/) is that it automatically converts linefeeds in known text files
(including ASM files) into DOS-compatible CR/LF sequences.
