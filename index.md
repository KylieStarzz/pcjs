Welcome to PCjs, home of [PCx86](/docs/pcx86/), the original IBM PC simulation that runs in your web browser.  It is
one of several JavaScript Machines in the [PCjs Project](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs), an open-source project that
includes:

* [PCx86](/docs/pcx86/), an x86-based emulator of the [IBM PC and PC-compatibles](/devices/pcx86/machine/)
* [PC8080](/modules/pc8080/), an 8080 machine emulator (see [Space Invaders](/devices/pc8080/machine/invaders/) and the [VT100 Terminal](/devices/pc8080/machine/vt100/))
* [C1Pjs](/docs/c1pjs/), an emulation of the 6502-based [Ohio Scientific Challenger 1P](/devices/c1p/)
* [PDPjs](/docs/pdpjs/), a set of machine emulation modules supporting the DEC [PDP-10](/devices/pdp10/machine/) and [PDP-11](/devices/pdp11/machine/)
* [PCjs Devices](/modules/devices/), for simple machines like the [TI-57 Calculator](/devices/ti57/), the [Game of Life](/devices/leds/life/), and [Lite-Brite](/devices/leds/litebrite/)

All PCjs machine simulations are written entirely in [JavaScript](/modules/).  No Flash, Java or other plugins are
required.  Supported browsers include modern versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer (v9.0 and up), Edge,
and assorted mobile browsers.

The [JavaScript Machine](/devices/pcx86/machine/5150/mda/64kb/) above uses [PCx86](/docs/pcx86/) configured with an Intel
8088 running at 4.77Mhz, with 64Kb of RAM and an IBM Monochrome Display Adapter.  For more control, there are also
[Control Panel](/devices/pcx86/machine/5150/mda/64kb/debugger/) and [Soft Keyboard](/devices/pcx86/machine/5150/mda/64kb/softkbd/)
configurations, featuring the built-in PCx86 Debugger.  For even greater control, build your own PC. The
[PCx86 Documentation](/docs/pcx86/) will help you get started.

PCx86 has steadily evolved to support more classic x86-based machines, including the IBM PC XT, the 80286-based IBM PC AT,
and the 80386-based COMPAQ DeskPro 386.  PCx86 fully supports the original machine ROMs, video cards, etc, and all
machines run at their original speeds.

The goals of the [PCjs Project](/docs/about/) are to create fast, full-featured simulations of classic
computer hardware, help people understand how these early machines worked, make it easy to experiment with different
machine configurations, and provide a platform for running and analyzing old computer software.

Demos
-----
Some pre-configured machines are shown below, ready to run BASIC, DOS, Windows, OS/2, and other assorted software.

There are many more [PCx86 Demos](/devices/pcx86/machine/#ready-to-run-app-demos), including an
[IBM PC with Dual Displays](/devices/pcx86/machine/5150/dual/64kb/) demonstrating early multi-monitor support,
and multiple IBM PC XT machines running side-by-side with [CGA Displays](/devices/pcx86/machine/5160/cga/256kb/array/)
and [EGA Displays](/devices/pcx86/machine/5160/ega/640kb/array/).

C1Pjs
-----
Below is the [OSI Challenger C1P](/docs/c1pjs/), another simulation in the PCjs Project.
It simulates Ohio Scientific's 6502-based microcomputer, released in 1978.  More details about this simulation
and the original machine are available in the [C1Pjs Documentation](/docs/c1pjs/).
