Challenger 1P Device Configurations
-----------------------------------

All our [Challenger 1P Machines](machine/) are built from a collection of devices, including:

* [Control Panels](panel/)
* CPU (6502)
* Debugger
* Floppy Drive Controller
* Keyboard
* [Machines](machine/)
* RAM
* [ROM](rom/)
* Serial Port
* [Video](video/)

Complete [machine configurations](machine/) are constructed from those devices.  A machine configuration is a single XML file
that lists all the device components to be used.  A machine XML file can choose to configure every device itself,
or it can include pre-configured device XML files, such as those provided above or elsewhere.

The project also includes an assortment of Challenger 1P [Applications](/apps/c1p/) and [Disk Images](/disks/c1p/).
