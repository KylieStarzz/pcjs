TI-57 Programming Documents
---------------------------

- [Train-ing With Your EC-4000 Programmable Calculator](Train-ing_With_Your_EC-4000_Programmable_Calculator.pdf)
- [EC-4000 Reference Card](EC-4000_Reference_Card.pdf)

I've also saved a few [Hand-Written EC-4000 Programs](EC-4000_Programs_1978-1979_By_Jeff_Parsons.pdf) from
1978-1979.  These are some of my earliest "computer programs," written when I was in high school, so needless to say,
they come with no guarantees of accuracy or fitness for any particular purpose.  Use at your own risk.
