### TI-57 Manuals

- [EC-4000 Reference Card](EC-4000_Reference_Card.pdf)
- [Train-ing With Your EC-4000 Programmable Calculator](Train-ing_With_Your_EC-4000_Programmable_Calculator.pdf)

### TI-57 Programs

I've archived a few of my own [Hand-Written EC-4000 Programs](EC-4000_Programs_1978-1979_By_Jeff_Parsons.pdf) from
1978-1979.  These are some of my earliest "computer programs," written when I was in high school, so needless to say,
they come with no guarantees.  Use at your own risk.
