Space Invaders (1978)
---

This is a test of [PC8080](/modules/pc8080/), a new 8080-based PCjs emulator running the original Space Invaders. 

It is currently playable only in desktop browsers and uses the following hard-coded key mappings:

- 1: One Player
- 2: Two Player
- 3: Insert Coin
- A: Move Left
- D: Move Right
- L: Fire Missile

See the [Debugger Configuration](/devices/pc8080/machine/invaders/debugger/) for more control of the machine, along
with assorted [Space Invaders Hardware Notes](/devices/pc8080/machine/invaders/debugger/#space-invaders-hardware-notes).
